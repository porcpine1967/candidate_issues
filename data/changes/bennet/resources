ABOUT MICHAEL 
Michael is running for president to build opportunity for every American and restore integrity to our government. He has demonstrated an ambitious vision for the future and the strength and experience to beat Trump in 2020.
Michael represents the State of Colorado in the Senate, but he has not spent a lifetime in politics. He turned around failing businesses in the private sector and improved outcomes for kids as superintendent of the Denver Public Schools. He’s relentlessly focused on building opportunity for the next generation. He’s viewed as a thoughtful and pragmatic voice and has won historically tough elections without compromising on his beliefs, core values, or positions on difficult issues. He lives in Denver with his wife, Susan Daggett, and their three daughters: Caroline, Halina, and Anne.
Michael has more experience winning tough races than anyone else running for president. He won elections in 2010 and 2016 — both difficult cycles for Democrats — in a state that is a third Republican, a third Independent, and a third Democrat. In 2010, he prevailed in a general election that saw Democrats lose races up and down the ballot as the Tea Party wave swept America. During that race, Michael said he would be willing to lose his seat over voting for the Affordable Care Act; rather than shy away from the issue, he held town halls in Colorado’s most conservative counties, defending his progressive position. In 2016, Michael won in areas of Colorado that Trump won, including Pueblo County, which he carried by nearly 10 percentage points. He won reelection with more votes than anyone in Colorado history.
MICHAEL’S VISION
Build economic opportunity: America calls itself the land of opportunity, but it doesn’t feel that way today. Wages are stagnant, costs are rising, and economic inequality in our country is only growing worse. To drive economic opportunity, Michael will work to ensure that when the economy grows, incomes for everyone grow. In the meantime, he will take immediate steps to increase wages and lower the costs of a middle-class life. And as a former school superintendent, he will recommit our country to delivering a quality education for every American.
Restore integrity to government: Corruption and dysfunction in Washington not only destroy the American people’s trust in government but also prevent us from making critical decisions for our future. Michael believes we need to restore trust in our government by dismantling pay-to-play politics, increasing transparency, and reinvigorating the democratic process. Michael will ban members of Congress from ever becoming lobbyists and overturn Citizens United to get unlimited dark money out of politics. He also will protect the right to vote, ensure the security of our elections, and reduce extreme partisanship in our electoral process — starting with his plan to make partisan gerrymandering illegal.

What People Are Saying About Michael

“Obama insisted that there were gifted Democratic politicians out there, but that many were new to the scene. He mentioned … Senator Michael Bennet, of Colorado.”
James Carville: “If they were going to go into a laboratory, and bring out the perfect candidate  someone who believes in public service, someone who is very smart, well spoken, decent, superintendent of schools in Denver. Successful in business. One of the two or three most respected in the US Senate. A manof total decency, really cares about the country.”
Former Senator Gary Hart: “Michael Bennet has the intelligence, experience, and judgment to put our nation back on track at home and abroad. He has more than his share of intellectual resources and a lifetime of public service. Michael Bennet is the soul of integrity and will restore dignity and respect so badly lacking in the White House today and restore our nation’s honor in the world.”
Former Colorado Governor Bill Ritter: “Michael has the ideas, character, and unrelenting focus on ending politics as usual that we need in our next president. I appointed Michael to the Senate because of his ability to bring people together to get things done—especially in trying times—and I know he will bring this same strength to the presidency. Michael knows how to build the broad coalition we will need to win purple states like ours and others in 2020. Michael’s record in the Senate shows us the kind of leader he will be in the White House: one with the intellect, humility, and ability to make progress on our most pressing challenges.”
Des Moines Register Editorial Board: “Iowa caucusgoers … would be well-served to give Bennet more attention.  He offers a much-needed reality check on the promises candidates are offering and what it will take to accomplish meaningful change.”
New Hampshire Union Leader: “Another moderate contending for attention is U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who continues to impress here in New Hampshire….”
The Economist: “Mr Bennet’s ideas are a foil to [Elizabeth Warren’s]. They are just as rigorous and technocratic, but more rooted in pragmatism.” He is “the candidate perhaps most intellectually capable of challenging the party’s leftward creep.”
Boston Globes Scot Lehigh: “It’s not enough simply to win the presidency, [Bennet] stresses. Democrats need to hold the House and retake the Senate. That means creating a broad coalition for change, one that extends beyond the deep blue states. That’s a tough truth from this smart, thoughtful political pragmatist — a candidate who has yet to get the attention he deserves.”
DNC Committee Member Bill Shaheen: “Senator Bennet is a serious contender, serious candidate, and would be a serious president.”
Former Ohio Governor Richard Celeste: “Michael is about as grounded an individual who has devoted a life to public service as I have ever met. He’s real. He’s authentic. He’s passionate. He’s curious, a student of history and is a total contrast to the guy who is there now.”
Former South Carolina Democratic Party Chair and former DNC Chairman Don Fowler: “Even though many of us are meeting you for the first time, I think it’s clear you know all you need to know to be president of the United States.”
Washington Post’s George Will: “Bennet is too serious a person to be content in today’s Senate, and if Democrats are as serious as they say they are about defeating Donald Trump, Bennet should be their nominee.”
MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough: “[T]ake a closer look at Bennet’s résumé and skill set, and it becomes clear that he could be the answer to the question that every Democrat — from the far left to the methodical middle — is asking: Who can win this race? … In many ways, Bennet melds the best of the last two Democrats to win the White House, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.”
