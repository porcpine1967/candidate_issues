Joe's leadership during
the COVID-19 Pandemic
Together, We Are Resilient and Strong
In the midst of a growing public health crisis the country is looking for leadership, stability, and  trusted experience — and that’s Vice President Joe Biden. Biden knows how to mount an effective crisis response and elevate the voices of scientists, public health experts, and first responders because he has done it before.
We need a decisive public health response to curb the spread of this disease and provide treatment to those in need — as well as a decisive economic response that delivers real relief to American workers, families, and small businesses, and protects the economy as a whole.
Joe’s been honest with the American people about what is necessary to beat this challenge, and knows that we are up to this task and that we will meet this challenge together as one America.

We need transparent, empathetic leadership in this moment of crisis for the American people.
Since the start of this mounting national health crisis, Joe Biden has laid out what he would do as president to address this crisis, to ensure working families, small businesses and communities get the help they need, and to provide our frontline and essential workers the tools to do their jobs safely:
04/04/20 - Joe Biden Urges President Trump to Appoint a Supply Commander
Today, Joe Biden issued the following statement and subsequent policy plan urging Donald Trump to appoint a Supply Commander to coordinate critical materials for all 50 states and U.S. territories:
“This public health crisis is foremost a human crisis, but it is also a crisis of supply, logistics and distribution. States, hospitals, and health care providers should not have to bid against one another, or against the federal government to get the supplies that they desperately need. Price gougers should not be able to take advantage of a market run amok, and we cannot allow an underground market to flourish for these critical supplies.
“We are in a war with this virus — and our soldiers in this war are the doctors, nurses, health care workers, first responders, firefighters and cops, sanitation, delivery, food, and transit workers. But they are on the front lines of this battle without the equipment they need to protect themselves and save lives.
“There are several reasons we are so far behind. First, there is no coordinated distribution of existing tests to states or identification of new testing sites where they can be administered quickly and effectively. Second, we still aren’t making enough tests, especially rapid point-of-care tests. Third, we don’t have enough personnel, or with enough protective gear, to administer tests. And finally, we haven’t developed sufficient lab capacity to provide rapid results. These are failures of organization, logistics, supply, and distribution.
“It is clear that the current structure President Trump has put in place is not working either because he hasnt fully empowered those in charge or because he hasnt made it clear that the mandate must be to take over the entire supply chain and determine the demand across all of our states, tribes and territories for these critical materials. In fact, there was a report yesterday that Trump Administration officials were still telling the Congress this week they prefer leaving it to the private sector.
“As a result, those on the front lines are not getting the equipment and protection they need and deserve. We need a Supply Commander to step up and take charge and get the doctors, nurses, health care workers, first responders, firefighters, and cops the equipment they need to protect themselves and save lives. We especially need to focus on traditionally underserved populations, as early data suggests they are once again being left behind in this response. Today, I’m putting forward my recommendation to President Trump to coordinate critical supplies for all 50 States and U.S. Territories: appoint a Supply Commander reporting directly to the President to work with governors and manage the production, acquisition, and distribution of critical materials.”
The Biden Plan to Coordinate Critical Materials for All 50 States and U.S. Territories
As commander in chief, it’s Trumps responsibility to get these essential workers what they need. Trump should immediately task a Supply Commander to take command of the national supply chain for essential equipment, medications, and protective gear. We can no longer leave this to the private sector. The Supply Commander should work with every governor to determine their needs, and then coordinate production and delivery of those needs in a timely and efficient manner. And, the Supply Commander should direct the distribution of critical equipment as cases peak at different times in different states or territories. That goes for ventilators, masks, gowns, face shields, lab equipment, tests and testing components, medicines, and all other critical materials.
Where they haven’t, states and territories should each appoint their own Supply Leads to coordinate with the federal effort and ensure a special emphasis on communities with traditionally underserved populations. This means requiring uniform data reporting to uncover the true extent of health disparities from COVID-19 and ensuring lifesaving equipment and supplies reaches them. The Supply Commander should report directly to Trump, not get buried in the bureaucracy, and transparently update the public daily on progress. The National Governors Association can assist in this effort by helping aggregate state’s demand in a uniform way with common definitions and reporting.
And, the Supply Commander must work with Governors to draw on the support of the National Guard and a newly hired and trained U.S. Public Health Corps, including mobilized AmeriCorps and Peace Corps volunteers and those laid off by this crisis, to assess inventory of critical supplies and assist with their equitable distribution among other functions.
04/03/20 - Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Today’s Jobs Report
This morning’s employment numbers are another clear warning sign that we need more action to stem the bleeding. On top of yesterday’s new unemployment claims data, it’s a flashing red light we should not ignore. The CARES Act was an important step — and we’ll begin to see it start helping, as long as it’s implemented well — but it won’t be enough. It’s clear to me, and it should be clear to everyone, that a lot more is needed. Fast, bold action to bolster American workers now will save more pain later. Congress must get to work immediately on the next package. We can’t afford to waste time. There are a number of things that will have to be done all at once, but our economic priority must be to stop the bleeding in the labor market and keep as many people on payroll as possible

04/02/20 - Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on Sanctions Relief During COVID-19
In times of global crisis, America should lead. We should be the first to offer help to people who are hurting or in danger. That’s who we are. That’s who we’ve always been. And, in the midst of this deadly pandemic that respects no borders, the United States should take steps to offer what relief we can to those nations hardest hit by this virus — including Iran — even as we prioritize the health of the American people

04/02/20 - Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on Record Number of Americans Filing for Unemployment
The economic damage from the worst public health crisis our country has faced in generations is both rising and deepening at an alarming rate. It is putting working families and the American middle class through unimaginable financial pain — and they need to be made whole as fast as possible. My heart goes out to the millions of Americans who filed for unemployment claims this week, and the millions more who worry what next week holds for them

03/29/20 - Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on the Need to Protect Dreamers
Today, we are still in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, but we know that hard days lie ahead. We know that we need everyone pulling together in support of our doctors, nurses, EMTs, and front line health care workers. And we know, beyond doubt, that we need every trained and qualified person we have fighting this virus — and that includes approximately 27,000 Dreamers who are working in hospitals and health care facilities all across our country thanks to their protections under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)

03/26/20 - Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on Record Unemployment Claims
Last week saw the largest single-week jump in new unemployment claims in American history — 3.3 million people filed for unemployment, and likely many more than that are now out of work as people are staying home to slow the spread of COVID-19. These numbers reflect overwhelming job losses in service industries like accommodation and food service, which means lower-income workers are already feeling the impact of this crisis in a major way. Secretary Mnuchin may think these numbers “are not relevant,” but for those who were already struggling to make ends meet, this is a very real crisis

03/23/20 - Joe Biden Presses Donald Trump and State Elected Officials to Drop Lawsuit Attacking Americans’ Health Care
All across this nation, Americans are anxious and afraid about the impact the deadly COVID-19 pandemic is already having on their lives, their families, and their ability to pay their bills. Individuals and families are stepping up to do their part — staying home, taking individual precautions and implementing social distancing, and making donations to support food banks and other vital service providers, all to protect those most at-risk from the virus in our communities. Their level of dedication should be matched by their elected leaders.

03/22/20 - On Congressional Economic Stimulus Negotiations
It’s simple: President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. And it’s simply wrong.
Here’s what’s happening. The White House and the Senate Republicans have proposed a $500 billion slush fund for corporations, with almost no conditions. Donald Trump’s Treasury Secretary would decide which big businesses get how much, and he can give out billions with virtually no strings attached. The Trump Administration could even allow companies to use taxpayers’ money for stock buybacks and executive pay packages, and they don’t have to tell Americans where the money is going for months

01/27/20 - OP-ED: Trump is worst possible leader to deal with coronavirus outbreak
The possibility of a pandemic is a challenge Donald Trump is unqualified to handle as president. I remember how Trump sought to stoke fear and stigma during the 2014 Ebola epidemic. He called President Barack Obama a “dope” and “incompetent” and railed against the evidence-based response our administration put in place — which quelled the crisis and saved hundreds of thousands of lives — in favor of reactionary travel bans that would only have made things worse. He advocated abandoning exposed and infected American citizens rather than bringing them home for treatment

We've got to inform and reassure the American people.
Donald Trump is not to blame for the coronavirus. But he does bear responsibility for the response. The American people need and deserve a leader who will give them the truth.
