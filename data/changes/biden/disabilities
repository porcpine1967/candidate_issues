HIGHLIGHTS: HOW JOE BIDEN’S PLANS WILL HELP PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
Joe Biden is running to restore the backbone of this country  the middle class. And this time, he’s going to make sure everyone gets to come along, including individuals with disabilities.
An estimated 43 million Americans have a disability, including 1 out of every 4 adults. Thus, Joe believes that every policy should be developed with consideration for impacts on people with disabilities. Below are just a few highlights of how his current plans do exactly that. In the months ahead, Biden will propose additional steps he will take as president to ensure that people with disabilities are treated with dignity and have a chance to be a part of the middle class.
The Biden Plan for Educators, Students, and Our Future

Biden will ensure that no child’s future is determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. This includes making sure children with disabilities have the support to succeed. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act promised to provide 40% of the extra cost of special education required by the bill. Currently, the federal government only covers roughly 14% of this cost, failing to live up to our commitment. The Biden Administration will fully fund this obligation within ten years. We must ensure that children with disabilities get the education and training they need to succeed.
The Biden Plan to Protect  Build on the Affordable Care Act

Today, the Affordable Care Act is still a big deal  especially for people with disabilities. Because of Obamacare, over 100 million people no longer have to worry that an insurance company will deny coverage or charge higher premiums just because they have a pre-existing condition – such as a disability. Insurance companies can no longer set annual or lifetime limits on coverage, which is especially critical for people with disabilities.
In addition to creating a new public option and taking other steps to reduce health care costs such as the price of prescription drugs, the Biden Plan will protect Medicare as we know it. Today, Medicare provides health insurance coverage to over 60 million older Americans and people with disabilities.  As president, Biden will continue to defend our nation’s commitment to older Americans and people with disabilities through Medicare, and he will keep Medicare as a separate and distinct program, and ensure there is no disruption to the current Medicare system.
The Biden Plan for Long-term Care 
Originally released as part of the Biden Plan for Older Americans

Biden will protect Medicaid and ensure its beneficiaries can access home and community-based long-term care when they want it. Medicaid pays for more long-term care than any other insurer in the country. In fact, roughly 6 in 10 individuals residing in nursing homes are enrolled in Medicaid, including many older Americans. Yet, the Trump Administration is reportedly considering a plan to cut Medicaid funding by turning it into a block grant. And Republican leadership in states like Iowa, where Medicaid has been privatized with devastating results for some of its most vulnerable residents, are not fulfilling their obligations under the program. The Biden Plan will protect Medicaid funding and make sure the program gives those on Medicaid who need long-term care the flexibility to choose home- and community-based care. In addition, the Biden Administration won’t let states skirt their duties under Medicaid and will take enforcement action against any state that allows profiteering to get in the way of Medicaid beneficiaries’ health.
The Biden Plan will also provide tax relief to help solve the long-term care challenge. The Biden Plan will also help Americans pay for long-term care by providing relief for Americans needing long-term care by creating a $5,000 tax credit for informal caregivers, modeled off of legislation supported by AARP. These informal caregivers – whether family members or other loved ones – have for too long been doing tireless work without any financial support.
The Biden Plan for Strengthening America’s Commitment to Justice

Too often, people with disabilities end up in our criminal justice system or injured because of interactions with law enforcement that should never have happened at all or should have happened differently. To change the nature of these interactions, the Biden Administration will fund initiatives to partner mental health and substance use disorder experts, social workers, and disability advocates with police departments. These service providers will train police officers to better de-escalate interactions with people in severe emotional distress before they become violent. They’ll also help police officers learn how to better approach individuals with certain disabilities, like those with autism or who are deaf, so misunderstanding does not lead to incarceration. And, these service providers will respond to calls with police officers so individuals who should not be in the criminal justice system are diverted to treatment for addiction or mental health problems, or are provided with the housing or other social services they may need.
