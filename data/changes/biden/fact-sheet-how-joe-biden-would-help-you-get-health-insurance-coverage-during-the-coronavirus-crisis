If you are currently covered by insurance thanks to Obamacare…
Joe would defend and build on Obamacare to give you a new public option and lower premiums. That’s a stark contrast with President Trump, who supports a lawsuit to get rid of Obamacare and junk health plans that weaken coverage protections for patients with pre-existing conditions.
If you just lost your employer-based coverage because you lost your job 
Joe would have the federal government step in and cover 100% of the cost of keeping you on your employer-based plan (called COBRA insurance)  that means neither you nor your employer would have to keep paying the premium, and youd get the same coverage you had before for the duration of the crisis. 
If you just lost your job but didn’t have employer-based coverage 
Joe would reopen enrollment for Obamacare plans and offer a Medicare-like public option, with the federal government providing enhanced premium subsidies.  
If you have coverage from your employer but it is inadequate…
Joe would give you the ability to choose a new Medicare-like public option, with the federal government providing enhanced premium subsidies.
If you are on Medicaid…
Joe would provide direct and increased federal support to Medicaid and keep it in place until we have succeeded in significantly reducing unemployment rates.
If you are nearing Medicare eligibility age…
Joe would lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60 to give you another choice. 
Biden Guarantee for All: No matter whether you are insured or how you are insured, Joe would make sure every single person in this country gets free testing and treatment for the coronavirus.
