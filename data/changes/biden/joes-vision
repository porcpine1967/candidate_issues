America is an idea.
An idea that goes back to our founding principle that all men are created equal. Its an idea thats stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator. It gives hope to the most desperate people on Earth. It instills in every single person in this country the belief that no matter where they start in life, theres nothing they can’t achieve if they work at it.
Were in a battle for the soul of America. Its time to remember who we are. Were Americans: tough, resilient, but always full of hope. Its time to treat each other with dignity. Build a middle class that works for everybody. Fight back against the incredible abuses of power were seeing. Its time to dig deep and remember that our best days still lie ahead.
Its time for respected leadership on the world stage—and dignified leadership at home. Its time for equal opportunity, equal rights, and equal justice. Its time for an economy that rewards those who actually do the work. Its time for a president who will stand up for all of us.
This is Joe’s Vision for America.
We've got to rebuild the backbone of the country: The Middle Class.
The middle class isn’t a number  it’s a set of values. Owning your home. Sending your kids to college. Being able to save and get ahead. Across the country, too many families are being left behind. The next president needs to understand what the current one doesn’t: In America, no matter where you start in life, there should be no limit to what you can achieve.
We need to rebuild the middle class, and this time make sure everybody comes along  regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
We’ve got to demonstrate respected leadership on the world stage.
The world is facing inescapable challenges: a rapidly changing climate, the risk of nuclear conflict, trade wars, a rising China and an aggressive Russia, millions of refugees seeking shelter and security, and attacks on universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. The next president must repair our relationships with our allies and stand up to strongmen and thugs on the global stage to rally the world to meet these challenges. We can reclaim our longstanding position as the moral and economic leader of the world.
We've got to make sure our democracy includes everyone.
Our politics is broken and excludes too many Americans. Until we fix campaign finance, voting rights, and gerrymandering, it will continue to get more polarized, more ugly, and more mean.
