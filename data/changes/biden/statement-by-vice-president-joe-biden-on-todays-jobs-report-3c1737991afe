This morning’s employment numbers are another clear warning sign that we need more action to stem the bleeding. On top of yesterday’s new unemployment claims data, it’s a flashing red light we should not ignore. The CARES Act was an important step — and we’ll begin to see it start helping, as long as it’s implemented well — but it won’t be enough. It’s clear to me, and it should be clear to everyone, that a lot more is needed. Fast, bold action to bolster American workers now will save more pain later. Congress must get to work immediately on the next package. We can’t afford to waste time. There are a number of things that will have to be done all at once, but our economic priority must be to stop the bleeding in the labor market and keep as many people on payroll as possible.
At the same time, we have a moral duty to ensure that those who are still working today, those on the front lines in essential jobs, have the protections they need, including personal protective equipment but also paid sick leave and health care.
