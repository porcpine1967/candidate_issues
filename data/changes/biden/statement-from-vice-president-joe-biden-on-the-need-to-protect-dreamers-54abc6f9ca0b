Today, we are still in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, but we know that hard days lie ahead. We know that we need everyone pulling together in support of our doctors, nurses, EMTs, and front line health care workers. And we know, beyond doubt, that we need every trained and qualified person we have fighting this virus — and that includes approximately 27,000 Dreamers who are working in hospitals and health care facilities all across our country thanks to their protections under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).
If the Supreme Court upholds President Trump’s termination of DACA in the midst of a national public health emergency, it will leave a gaping hole in our health care system that is liable to cost American lives. Dreamers are deeply ingrained in every aspect of our society, including as doctors and nurses, home health aides, and physicians assistants. They are Americans in every way that matters — including an admirable American spirit of selfless service to others. We should never endanger or throw into question their ability to contribute to our nation, but to do so in a moment of national crisis is beyond misguided. I am proud to add my voice to those calling on the U.S. Supreme Court to invalidate President Trump’s wrongful — legally and morally — termination of the Deferred Action program President Obama and I established, and protect these brilliant and dedicated young people. They deserve our gratitude — and Congress should take action to ensure they receive the full protection of the law they have earned, as citizens.
