Clean Buildings
Burning gas or oil to provide heat and hot water to homes and buildings contributes to climate change as well as health problems like asthma, especially in lower-income communities. But we have the technology now to eliminate this pollution and reduce energy bills by upgrading buildings and replacing equipment and appliances that burn gas and oil furnaces with electric ones. Unfortunately, the Trump administration is undermining current energy standards and delaying the adoption of new ones.
Mike will build on his success as New York City’s mayor, when he worked with building managers and unions to replace the dirtiest oil boilers and invest in energy-saving renovations. He will help homeowners, building owners and tenants upgrade their homes and buildings to save energy and eliminate pollution. And he’ll prioritize the low-income communities and communities of color that have been most affected by pollution see the benefits.
How Mike Will Get It Done:
Create a national program to invest in upgrading homes and buildings to save energy and reduce pollution
Set a goal of 100% pollution free construction for new homes and buildings by 2025
Shift equipment and appliances from fossil fuels to clean energy, to increase energy efficiency and reduce pollution
Make clean buildings affordable for everyone, and make sure building investments create good jobs
Support research and development to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of heat pumps and other building systems
Mike’s Plan:
Create a national program to invest in upgrading homes and buildings to save energy and reduce pollution
Mike will create a national program to offer rebates, tax credits, and low-cost financing to make it affordable for homeowners and building owners, especially lower-income and middle-class families, to renovate homes and buildings and replace old appliances with new pollution-free ones. He’ll work with contractors and retailers to make the program available everywhere, and work with electricians, installers, and building managers to make sure the program creates good local jobs.
Set a goal of 100% pollution free construction for new homes and buildings by 2025
Mike will direct the Department of Energy to help develop a state-of-the-art model building code that reduces energy use, uses pollution-free equipment and appliances instead of fossil fuels, promotes low-carbon building materials, and ensures that new homes and buildings are set up ready for solar power or electric-vehicle charging. He will provide resources and technical assistance to help states and cities adopt and enforce stronger building codes and he’ll require all federal buildings to comply with them.
Mike will help reduce pollution, make our homes and buildings more energy-efficient and save Americans money on their heating and energy bills.
Shift equipment and appliances from fossil fuels to clean energy, to increase energy efficiency and reduce pollution
Mike aims to shift to new equipment and appliances running on clean energy instead of fossil fuels as soon as possible. He will direct the Department of Energy to strengthen appliance efficiency standards and work with other agencies to limit air pollution from furnaces, boilers, and water heaters. He’ll also update the Energy Star program, and tax incentives for energy-efficient appliances, to encourage the shift.
Make clean buildings affordable for everyone, and make sure building investments create good jobs
In addition to rebates and low-cost financing to make home energy upgrades affordable for all families, Mike will support programs to make sure renters see the benefits of cleaner buildings. He’ll incorporate energy-saving measures in low-income housing programs and increase funding for federal programs that help low-income families weatherize homes. And he’ll work with building trades unions to connect workers to new jobs, and make sure new infrastructure jobs are good jobs, applying prevailing-wage and Buy American standards and supporting the right to organize.
Support research and development to make clean technology more affordable, improve building systems, and encourage a smart grid
Mike will support research and development to improve the efficiency and affordability of heat pumps and other high-performance building equipment, systems, and low-carbon materials. He’ll support research and development, and provide funding and technical assistance to states, to encourage the build-out of a smart energy grid that values on-site clean energy, energy storage, energy efficiency, and demand response.
Mike’s Record:
Mike has a strong record of making homes and buildings more energy-efficient.
Mike created the Bloomberg Philanthropies American Cities Climate Challenge, making a $70 million investment to empower 25 of the biggest American cities to implement their near-term climate goals, with a focus on clean transportation and buildings. The 25 cities in the Climate Challenge are projected to collectively reduce 40 million metric tons of carbon emissions by 2025.
As mayor, Mike drove carbon reductions in the country’s largest city by adopting pioneering policies that made New York City buildings cleaner and more efficient. He increased energy efficiency and reduced the city’s carbon footprint by 13 percent.
Mike will lead America into a clean energy future.
