Clean Transportation
Fossil fuel-powered transportation is the biggest contributor to climate change and also contributes to asthma and heart conditions, often hitting low-income communities hardest. There are new and affordable solutions to this problem, but President Trump is determined to increase pollution and worsen the climate crisis. His administration is working to repeal federal gas mileage and pollution standards and block states from setting stronger standards that promote electric vehicles.
As part of his plans to modernize America’s infrastructure and fight climate change, Mike will lead a national initiative to reduce pollution and improve our transportation system. He will put in place new cutting-edge standards that will lead to 100% of new vehicles sold being electric by 2035. He also will invest in replacing diesel trucks and buses with electric ones in areas with the worst air quality and will improve public transit systems to give more Americans better transportation choices.
How Mike Will Get It Done:
Make electric vehicles affordable for all families
Strengthen gas mileage and pollution standards for cars and trucks, and add a national zero-emissions vehicle standard
Reduce diesel pollution from trucks and buses and help businesses and school districts choose electric vehicles
Build a network of charging stations along the interstate highway system
Invest in improving local and regional public transit systems and create good jobs
Mike’s Plan:
Make electric vehicles affordable for all families
Mike will make electric vehicles affordable for all families by extending tax credits for electric vehicles and reforming them to work as point-of-sale rebates for families for whom tax credits don’t work. He also will launch a national Clean Cars for All program that offers middle- and lower-income families who trade in older, polluting vehicles vouchers they can use for an electric vehicle or for public transit systems.
Strengthen gas mileage and pollution standards for cars and trucks, and add a national zero-emissions vehicle standard
Mike will immediately reverse the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken gas mileage and pollution standards, reinstate states’ ability to set stronger standards, and start the process of strengthening national standards. He will push automakers to make electric vehicles available in more communities with a national zero-emissions vehicle standard modeled on policies in ten states, ramping up to eventually require that all new passenger vehicles be pollution-free by 2035.
Reduce diesel pollution from trucks and buses and help businesses and school districts choose electric vehicles
Mike will partner with communities that have serious air pollution challenges, which are often low-income communities and communities of color, by bringing together private operators of delivery truck fleets and school districts and cities that own bus fleets to replace polluting vehicles with electric ones. He will use low-interest loans and tax credits to make electric vehicles more affordable.
Build a network of charging stations along the interstate highway system
Mike will make charging an electric vehicle as convenient as buying a gallon of gas. He will build a network of charging systems at rest areas along the interstate highway system, using tax credits and low-cost financing, with the goal of placing a station every 50 miles. He will include incentives to install truck charging at truck stops, particularly in busy freight corridors, and in rural areas, including on farms.
Invest in improving local and regional public transit systems and create good jobs
Mike will triple investment in public transit, bike and pedestrian infrastructure. He will improve inter-city bus service. Mike also will plan and design regional high-speed rail networks, working with states to have at least one new high-speed rail corridor built by 2025. He will work to address freight bottlenecks and encourage more shipping by lower carbon modes such as rail and barge. Mike also will make sure new transportation jobs are good jobs, applying prevailing-wage and Buy American standards and supporting the right to organize.
Mike will make sure 100% of new vehicles are pollution-free by 2035.
Mike’s Record:
Mike has an unmatched record of reducing carbon emissions, improving public transit systems, and making communities more pedestrian-friendly.
Mike created Bloomberg Philanthropies’ American Cities Climate Challenge, a $70 million investment to empower 25 U.S. cities to carry out their near-term climate goals, with a focus on citywide clean transportation and buildings. The 25 cities are projected to collectively eliminate 40 million metric tons of carbon emissions by 2025. Cities from San Diego to Minneapolis to Boston are expanding bus and bike lanes, adding electric vehicles to their municipal fleets, boosting adoption of public transit and pioneering “mobility hubs” to increase access to low-carbon transit.
As mayor, Mike led innovations to improve public transit, fix crumbling infrastructure and create car-free pedestrian plazas – helping to make New York City’s air the cleanest it had been in 50 years. He launched Select Bus Service, a strategy to bring faster, reliable transit to communities that lacked access to jobs, schools and services. By the time Mike left office, the rapid bus initiative was speeding the commute of more than 200,000 daily riders. Mike also pushed for the extension of the 7 subway line, the first subway extension funded by the city in more than 60 years. And he created 400 miles of bike lanes across the city and launched the Citi Bike bike share program, which grew to become the nation’s largest and most successful bike share system, with nearly 90 million rides in six years.
