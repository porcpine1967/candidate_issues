Fighting for a bright, sustainable future
Mike is a global leader in the fight against the climate crisis and has helped drive progress on every continent through his role as the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Climate Action. He has worked with cities, states, and businesses to keep our country moving forward on climate change despite President Trump’s failed attempts to drag us backwards. As president, Mike will ensure the federal government leads an ambitious agenda to accelerate the U.S. toward a clean energy economy, putting us on the pathway to full decarbonization before mid-century.

Mike’s partnership with the Sierra Club to replace U.S. coal-fired power plants with clean energy has led to over 300 coal plant closures and 10,000 fewer deaths from coal pollution each year.
