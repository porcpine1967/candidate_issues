Climate Change
Whether President Trump acknowledges it or not, climate change poses the greatest threat of our time – not just to the environment, but to public health, the economy and society. If we don’t act now, we will face more frequent extreme weather events that will displace coastal communities, devastate farms and businesses, and spread disease.
Mike will restore American leadership in the fight against climate change by slashing U.S. carbon emissions and investing in clean-energy projects that not only minimize rising temperatures, but also lead to new jobs, cleaner air and water, cheaper power, more transportation options, and less congested roads.
How Mike Will Get It Done:
Cut economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030
Reduce pollution from buildings and transportation
Rejoin the Paris Agreement
Help communities cope with climate change
Prioritize the fight to prevent wildfires
