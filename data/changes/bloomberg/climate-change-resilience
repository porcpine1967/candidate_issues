Climate Change Resilience
Mike Bloomberg will put in place bold plans to rein in carbon pollution and avoid the worst effects of climate change, but the reality is that climate change is here and getting worse. President Trump denies the existence of climate change and refuses to prepare our country for increasingly destructive natural disasters and extreme weather events, going so far as to reverse preparations put in place by President Obama.
Mike will invest in resilience projects around the country, prioritizing the low-income communities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. He also will create an Infrastructure Resilience Finance Corporation to invest in making neighborhoods and critical infrastructure, such as telecommunications and public safety systems, more resilient. And he will launch a national initiative to use climate data to improve resilience efforts.
How Mike Will Get It Done:
Invest in resilience projects around the country, prioritizing vulnerable low-income communities
Restore and protect natural areas, such as floodplains and wetlands, that can protect communities from flood and drought
Protect critical infrastructure and create an Infrastructure Resilience Finance Corporation
Launch a national initiative to use climate data to improve resilience efforts
Ensure the federal government leads the way in promoting climate resilience
Mike’s Plan:
Invest in resilience projects around the country, prioritizing vulnerable low-income communities
Mike will create a federal Climate-Safe Communities program to help cities, states, and the private sector invest in resilience projects, giving priority to vulnerable low-income communities, communities of color, and people with disabilities who often experience the worst impacts of a disaster. He also will start a national Cooler Communities program to support strategies to reduce hotter urban temperatures, such as expanding urban tree cover, installing reflective roofs and pavement, and making sure seniors and other vulnerable people have access to cool spaces during heat waves.
Restore and protect natural areas that can protect communities from climate change
Wetlands and floodplains can reduce the severity of floods and droughts, sand dunes and barrier islands can mitigate storm surges during hurricanes, and restoring forests to ecological health reduces the risk of catastrophic wildfires. Mike will implement a national strategy to increase the resilience of federal lands to climate impacts, use Farm Bill incentives to encourage farmers to do the same on private lands, and support matching grants for cities and states protecting lands that can protect communities.
Mike will invest in resilience projects across the country to reduce the risks climate change poses to our communities.
Protect critical infrastructure and create an Infrastructure Resilience Finance Corporation
Mike will coordinate with the private sector to ensure that critical infrastructure is protected – including telecommunications, energy and public safety systems. Mike will finance needed investments in updating infrastructure, preparing communities, and restoring natural lands by creating an Infrastructure Resilience Finance Corporation to give loans, credit, and grants to help cities, states, and private owners of critical infrastructure invest in resilience projects.
Launch a national initiative to use climate data to improve resilience efforts
Mike will launch a national initiative to provide cities, states, and the private sector with technical assistance and access to climate data, maps and best practices to strengthen resilience efforts.
Ensure the federal government leads the way in promoting climate resilience
Mike will require that all new federal infrastructure be made resilient to climate change. He also will reinstate rules under the National Environmental Policy Act requiring that environmental reviews of infrastructure projects include a full assessment of climate impacts.
Mike’s Record:
Mike is a proven leader with years of experience making New York City more resilient to climate change.
As mayor, Mike navigated extreme weather events and invested in making the city safer from the inevitable effects of climate change. He launched a $20 billion resilience and rebuilding initiative to minimize flood risk, reinforce the city’s critical infrastructure against storm and climate risk and bolster communications technology. He updated building codes to account for climate-related threats, including flooding and extreme heat, and committed more than $6 million, with another $4 million in matching funds, in a public-private neighborhood green infrastructure program.
