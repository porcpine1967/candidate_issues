Public Safety  Criminal Justice
Mike Bloomberg is committed to reducing incarceration and making the criminal justice system fair for all. As mayor of New York City, he succeeded in doing both while making New York the safest big city in America.
Mike proposes criminal justice reforms that will dramatically reduce the rate of juvenile incarceration; invest in alternatives to incarceration that help offenders escape the cycle of crime; and expand local, community-based violence intervention programs nationwide.
How Mike Will Get It Done:
Expand alternative-to-incarceration programs
Restore Pell grants for incarcerated individuals
Eliminate cash bail
Eliminate juvenile incarceration for non-violent offenders
Break the cycle of violence
Mike’s Plan:
Expand Alternative-to-Incarceration Programs
Mike will push to expand alternative-to-incarceration programs that have a proven record of success. He’ll expand drug treatment, mental health services, and re-entry and career-training for people who are incarcerated. He will restore access to Pell Grant funding for incarcerated individuals, allowing them to pay for post-secondary education while in prison. And he will lower barriers to hiring for public employee and government contractor positions by “banning the box” so job applicants are not asked about their criminal records until after they receive a conditional offer.
Eliminate cash Bail
Mike will work to pass a bill outlawing cash bail. Americans are spending more than $13 billion a year to incarcerate people who are awaiting trial – in other words, who haven’t yet been convicted of a crime. Many have been granted bail but can’t afford to pay. African Americans and Latinos are less likely to be granted bail.
Cut Imprisonment of Young People
Mike will launch a nationwide initiative to cut imprisonment of young people in half by the end of his first term and eliminate juvenile incarceration for all non-violent offenders.
Break the Cycle of Violence
Mike’s plan will invest at least $100 million annually in strategies that prevent retaliation and disrupt patterns of gun violence. When Mike was mayor, New York invested more than $2 million to support public-health models of violence prevention, such as Cure Violence, which focused on sending credible messengers to the highest risk communities to speak with the highest-risk youth. In areas of New York that implemented Cure Violence, gun violence rates fell by as much as 63 percent. It’s time for the federal government to fund this critical work.

Mike Talks About How He Will Enact Criminal Justice Reform
Mike’s Record:
Under Mike’s leadership, New York City was the safest big city in America.
During Mike’s 12 years as mayor, the murder rate fell by half.
Driven by investments in community-focused approaches and support services, like the Juvenile Justice Initiative, Mike cut youth detention by 36%. Mike also pioneered new alternatives to incarceration that helped reduce the number of people behind bars by nearly 40% in New York City, even as incarceration rates rose nationwide.
Mike also pioneered reform efforts that transformed probation into a community reinvestment model that serves people where they live. With a mandate to get people out of the system, over several years New York City reduced the rate of adult probation violations by 45%. Between 2001 and 2009, the felony re-arrest rate for newly sentenced individuals on probation fell by 20%.
