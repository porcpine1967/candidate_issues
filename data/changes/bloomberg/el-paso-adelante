Latino Empowerment
Donald Trump launched his campaign for president with a racist rant. In office, he has continued to vilify and dehumanize the Latino community and inflame bigotry with hateful language — and his policies have made Americans, including Latinos, less economically secure. As president Mike Bloomberg will reverse that damage by addressing hate crimes and gun violence, closing the education, wealth and health gaps for Latinos, protecting voting rights and creating a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in America.
How Mike Will Get It Done:
Eliminate the college completion gap for Latinos
Double the number of Latino businesses with employees in 10 years
Reduce the gap for chronic diseases that disproportionately affect Latinos
Clear the naturalization backlog
Create a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants
Mike unveiled “El Paso Adelante” — his plan to invest in Latino communities to boost prosperity and economic security — in El Paso, Texas, on January 29, 2020.
Mike’s Plan:
Close the college completion gap
Mike’s plan will enable more Latinos to be able to afford a quality college education without taking on crushing debt to complete their degrees. His plan will make public colleges and universities free for low-income students and will offer more “learn and earn” opportunities through apprenticeships. Mike’s plan will also provide more Latinos with opportunities to gain credentials and work experiences needed for middle-skill jobs that provide family-sustaining wages.
Build Latino wealth
Mike’s plan will narrow the income and wealth gaps for Latinos through higher wages, higher levels of home ownership and business growth. He will empower entrepreneurs and improve access to capital in order to double the number of Latino-owned businesses with employees in 10 years. He will reform financial systems so that Latinos have greater access to credit and banking costs less.
Improve Latino health
Mike will expand access to health care and provide children and families with healthier living environments. Mike’s plan also includes comprehensive approaches to addressing gun violence, hate crimes, pollution, climate change and other issues impacting Latino health and safety.
Help immigrants become citizens
Mike will clear the naturalization backlog and create a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million people living in the shadows. He will provide permanent protections for Dreamers and Temporary Protected Status holders, shielding them from deportation and putting them on a pathway to citizenship. Additionally, Mike’s plan will expand immigration legal services. Read Mike’s full immigration plan.
Mike’s Record:
Mike has a long record of championing the Latino community.
As mayor, Mike signed executive orders guaranteeing immigrants rights to government services and medical care, as well as protecting victims of crime regardless of immigration status. Mike made significant education reforms for public schools and colleges that resulted in higher graduation rates for Latino students. He also launched initiatives to support immigrant-owned businesses.
In addition, Mike established NYCitizenship to help city government employees who were permanent residents apply for citizenship, and later expanded the initiative to families of NYC public school students. He also expanded legal services to immigrants by adding a full-time attorney to the city’s Family Justice Centers to counsel domestic violence victims and secured a full-time immigration attorney from each of the city’s 10 indigent criminal defense providers.
