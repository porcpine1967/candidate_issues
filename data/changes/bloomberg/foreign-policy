Foreign Policy
Proven global leadership
After leading New York City’s recovery from the 9/11 attacks, Mike knows that defending our country is a president’s most important task. For 12 years, he was responsible for protecting the lives of millions who live and work in one of the world’s most vital cities. He did so by hiring the smartest and most capable professionals, and listening to their advice. He put in place decision-making structures that enabled fast, well-considered action. He invested in intelligence-gathering and deterrence. And he worked closely with partners around the country and the world – as he has continued to do in his efforts to battle global climate change.
Crises cannot be predicted, but how leaders respond can. Unlike President Trump, a Bloomberg administration won’t act rashly in a crisis. It will think through the consequences of its actions, both immediate and long-term. And when Mike acts, he will do so just as Americans would hope – calmly, decisively and, above all, effectively.
