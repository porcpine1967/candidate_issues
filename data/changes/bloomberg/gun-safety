Gun Safety
Mike Bloomberg sees the gun violence crisis as a true national emergency and has promised that gun safety will be a top priority as president. He understands that every day, 100 Americans are killed with guns and hundreds more are injured, and that the impact of gun violence reaches well beyond these casualties — shaping the lives of millions of Americans who witness it, know someone who was shot, or live in fear of the next shooting.
Mikes Plan
Mike believes we need a president who will make gun violence a top priority – and who has a track record of taking on the NRA and winning. Hes done it.
Mike’s candidacy is about getting things done. That’s why he has offered a new gun safety policy proposal aimed at stopping the epidemic of gun violence in America. This comprehensive gun safety policy includes five key pillars designed to create an effective background checks system, keep guns away from people who pose a danger to themselves or others, protect young people in schools and Americans in their homes, tackle daily gun violence in the hardest-hit communities, and confront the gun industry head-on.
Mike’s comprehensive gun safety policy proposal includes:
More effective background checks
Create an effective background check system so that no one can purchase a gun without passing a completed background check.
Require point-of-sale background checks for all gun sales and finally close the private sale loophole, which enables prohibited people to buy guns simply by finding unlicensed sellers at gun shows or on the Internet.
Require every gun buyer to get a permit before making a purchase.
Use sales records to identify crime guns and notify local police when individuals have been prohibited from having a gun. A central system will let local authorities know when a gun owner has become barred from having firearms – due to a criminal conviction or a restraining order.
Allow for extreme risk screening before guns are purchased so that issuers would be equipped to deny licenses to troubled people who pose a danger to themselves or others.
Curb the dangers of downloadable guns and ghost guns by reversing Trump’s proposed firearm export regulations that loosen oversight of gun exports—and make it easier to publish 3D-printing gun blueprints online. And work to pass legislation barring online publication of those files.
Keep guns out of the wrong hands
Close loopholes, including one that prohibits married domestic abusers from possessing guns, but not unmarried ones.
Close the “boyfriend loophole” which allows domestic abusers to have guns, despite criminal convictions or restraining orders—simply because they are not married to their victims.
Pass a federal red flag law that expands extreme risk orders to 50 states—and funds state efforts to maximize the policy.
Require gun buyers to be at least 21 years old to buy handguns and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns.
Set a temporary bar on gun possession by assault and other violent misdemeanor offenders.
Protect our children and communities by banning assault weapons, protecting schools, and preventing unintentional shootings
Reinstate the federal ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
Require secure storage of firearms which have been shown to reduce the risk of child gun injuries by up to 85 percent. However, an estimated 4.6 million American children live in houses with an unlocked gun.
Ban all guns in K-12 schools, colleges, and universities – except for law enforcement.
Tackle daily gun violence in the hardest-hit communities
Fund at least $100 million annually for local violence intervention programs.
Increase ATF funding by up to $100 million annually so that the Bureau is able to police the gun industry more effectively.
Fund at least $100 million annually for public health research into gun violence.
Require all gun buyers to wait at least 48 hours before any firearm purchase.
Make straw purchasing and trafficking stand-alone federal crimes, with serious penalties for offenders in order to help stop illicit sales.
Require all gun owners must report to police if their firearms have been lost or stolen, within 3 days after they know or should know that their guns are missing.
Hold the Gun Industry accountable and elevate government’s response to the gun violence crisis
Repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) so that gunmakers and gun dealers will no longer have broad immunity from civil lawsuits.
Allow the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to treat guns like other household products so that the federal government will have the power to set safety requirements for gun technology.
Formally declare the gun violence crisis to be a public health emergency to expedite funds and research.
Appoint a White House gun coordinator to mobilize the public to fight gun violence and launch an interagency hub to fight gun violence.
Focus executive energy on suicide reduction, school safety interventions, and corporate partnerships.

Mikes Record
When Mike first started working on gun violence some 15 years ago, not many politicians in either party were interested in talking about the issue.
As mayor, Mike took on gun dealers and gun show vendors across the country that were feeding the criminal market. He co-founded Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition that grew to 1,000 mayors and revived an issue that many Democrats had left for dead.
During Mike’s time as mayor, firearm deaths decreased by 46% and the firearm death rate was less than a third the rate in the rest of the country. And, when he left City Hall, he didn’t walk away from this fight – he got even more involved. Having merged Mayors Against Illegal Guns with the grassroots group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, he helped launch Everytown for Gun Safety – which has six million supporters and is the country’s most powerful grass-roots force for gun safety.
Taking on the NRA
At a time when elected officials from both parties ran from the NRA, Mike built national gun safety coalitions to take them on. He has spent years and hundreds of millions of dollars fighting gun violence and supporting successful campaigns for smart state safety laws. As president, Mike will continue to back common-sense policies that save lives.
Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action, groups that Mike champions, lead the charge on gun safety with 6 million supporters.
Mike spent $110 million to elect candidates strong on gun safety in the 2018 midterm elections.
Mike launched groundbreaking undercover investigations to root out illegal gun sales by private sellers.
