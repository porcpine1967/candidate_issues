Gun Safety
Every day 100 Americans are killed by gun violence. It’s simply too easy for people who pose a risk of violence to themselves and others to get guns. Most Americans support common-sense gun safety laws like stronger background checks. But President Trump’s unacceptable deference to the NRA has allowed the bloodshed to continue. Mike’s plan builds on his decades of standing up to the gun lobby and protects 2nd Amendment rights, while enacting common-sense laws that save lives.
Build a more effective background check system
Keep guns out of the wrong hands
Tackle daily gun violence in the hardest-hit communities
Ban assault weapons, protect kids, and protect schools
Hold the gun industry accountable and elevate government’s response to the gun violence crisis

Mike’s Plan:
Build a more effective background check system
Mike’s plan will require point-of-sale background checks for all gun sales and finally close the private sale loophole, which enables prohibited people to buy guns simply by finding unlicensed sellers at gun shows or on the Internet. It will require every gun buyer to get a permit before making a purchase. It will use sales records to identify crime guns and notify local police when individuals have been prohibited from having a gun. Mike plan’s will allow for extreme risk screening before guns are purchased, so that issuers would be equipped to deny permits to troubled people who pose a danger to themselves or others. It will curb the dangers of downloadable guns and ghost guns by reversing Trump’s proposed firearm export regulations that loosen oversight of gun exports and make it easier to publish 3D-printing gun blueprints online. And Mike will work to pass legislation barring online publication of those files.
More than 36,000 people are killed with guns in the U.S. each year. 2,900 are children.
Keep guns out of the wrong hands
Mike’s plan will close the “boyfriend loophole” which allows domestic abusers to have guns, despite criminal convictions or restraining orders – simply because they are not married to their victims. It will pass a federal red flag law that expands extreme risk orders to 50 states – and funds state efforts to maximize the policy. It will require gun buyers to be at least 21 years old to buy handguns and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns. And it will set a temporary ban on gun possession by assault and other violent misdemeanor offenders.
Tackle daily gun violence in the hardest-hit communities
Mike’s plan will fund at least $100 million annually for local violence intervention programs like Cure Violence, and it will increase ATF funding by up to $100 million annually so that the Bureau is able to police the gun industry more effectively. It will fund at least $100 million annually for public health research into gun violence. It will require all gun buyers to wait at least 48 hours before any firearm purchase, and require all gun owners must report to police if their firearms have been lost or stolen, within 3 days after they know or should know that their guns are missing. It will also make straw purchasing and trafficking stand-alone federal crimes, with serious penalties for offenders in order to help stop illicit sales.
Firearms are the second leading cause of death for children and teens and the first leading cause of death for Black children and teens in the U.S.
Ban assault weapons, protect kids, and protect schools
Mike will reinstate the federal ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines; current assault weapons owners will be allowed to keep their guns, but will have to report them to federal officials. He will require secure storage of firearms when they are not in use, which has been shown to reduce the risk of child gun injuries by up to 85 percent. He will also ban all guns in K-12 schools, colleges, and universities – except for law enforcement.
Hold the gun industry accountable
Mike’s plan will repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) so that gunmakers and gun dealers will no longer have broad immunity from civil lawsuits. It will allow the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to treat guns like other household products so that the federal government will have the power to set safety requirements for gun technology. It will formally declare the gun violence crisis to be a public health emergency to expedite funds and research. Mike will appoint a White House gun coordinator to mobilize the public to fight gun violence and launch an interagency hub to fight gun violence. And he will focus executive energy on suicide reduction, school safety interventions, and corporate partnerships.

Mike’s Record:
When Mike first started working on gun violence some 15 years ago, not many politicians in either party were interested in talking about the issue. 
As mayor, Mike took on gun dealers and gun show vendors across the country that were feeding the criminal market. He co-founded Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition that grew to 1,000 current and former mayors and refocused attention on an issue that many Democrats had abandoned.
During Mike’s time as mayor, firearm deaths decreased by 48 percent and the firearm death rate was less than a third the rate in the rest of the country. When he left City Hall, he didn’t walk away from this fight – he got even more involved. Having merged Mayors Against Illegal Guns with the grassroots group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, he helped launch Everytown for Gun Safety – which boasts six million supporters and is the country’s most powerful grass-roots force for gun safety.
In the 2018 midterm elections, Mike spent $110 million to elect candidates strong on gun safety, which was instrumental in Democrats retaking the House. As president, Mike will continue to take on the NRA and back common-sense policies that save lives.
