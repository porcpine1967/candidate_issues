Homelessness
Helping those most in need.
When Mike was mayor, no city devoted more energy and resources to combating homelessness than New York City. His administration nearly doubled the city budget for homeless services and cut street homelessness.
Mike’s Record on Homelessness
Mike’s team began counting the number of people who lived on the streets, which helped reduce street homelessness by 28 percent, inspiring other cities to follow and do their own street counts.
Mike ordered a notorious family intake center to be torn down and replaced it with a new, modern $65 million facility that improved people’s experience with city government.
Mike partnered with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to create Operation Home, a task force to combat veteran homelessness in New York City.
Mike’s final city budget included $981 million for homeless services – almost double the amount the city had spent the year before he took office.
Bloomberg Philanthropies is working with cities in the U.S. and abroad to tackle homelessness, building on lessons learned while leading New York City.
