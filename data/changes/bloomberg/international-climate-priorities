International Climate Priorities
Mike Bloomberg is one of America’s leading climate activists, and plans to put an unprecedented focus on climate in the general election, and make climate one of his top priorities as president. His domestic climate agenda, which will be announced in further detail in coming weeks, builds on a strong record of implementing and advocating for specific, proven solutions that cities, states, businesses and environmentalists have adopted to speed up progress on climate.

Mike’s climate agenda will include both international and domestic initiatives. Highlights of his international climate initiatives include:
1. Immediately re-join the Paris Agreement and meet the targets science tells us.
Mike will notify the U.N. to re-enter the Paris Agreement and significantly increase the U.S. commitment to reduce emissions to lead the world by example, aiming to meet the targets science tells us are necessary to reverse climate change and remain at 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. He will work with mayors and governors to mobilize citizens around the country to come out in force and show the world that the U.S. is coming back stronger than before.
Consult with cities, states, and tribal governments to create a national roadmap to achieve the new 2030 target, and holding immediate talks with the top 20 emitting countries to bring them into alignment as well.
Hold countries accountable for their emissions reductions targets, and ensure the data needed to measure their progress towards these targets is transparent to the public. Provide technical assistance to countries that need help in determining and achieving their emissions reductions targets.
Restore U.S. contributions to the Green Climate Fund, such that the developed countries meet and exceed their goal to contribute $100 billion a year to developing countries, and ensuring that this funding effectively gets these countries to access affordable clean energy and strengthen their resilience to natural disasters.
Address reductions in all greenhouse gases, including harmful refrigerants, methane, and black-carbon emissions. Submit the Kigali Amendment to the Senate for ratification; improve satellite detection of methane leaks worldwide; reinstate U.S. leadership on the Arctic Council and prioritize the removal of black carbon from the atmosphere; and strengthen efforts to reduce emissions from the shipping and aviation industries.
2. Make climate change a top priority of U.S. foreign policy, and intensify U.S. and international actions to stop the expansion of coal and otherwise lower emissions.
Use trade and security agreements to strongly encourage that all countries with whom we have diplomatic relations are party to the Paris Agreement and have a verifiable plan to reduce emissions.
Calculate the costs of U.S. climate change efforts and apply a corresponding border adjustment  a charge on imports and a tax break for exports  for emissions-intensive goods.
Work with other countries to jointly end export assistance for fossil fuel investments.
Hold governments accountable and penalize corporations responsible for deforestation and other practices that increase climate change and rob indigenous peoples of their lives and communities.
Mandate the disclosure of all climate-related risks, including the full cost of retiring fossil-fuel assets, and greenhouse gas reporting. Furthermore, institute stress testing of financial institutions, including banks. Work with financial regulators around the world to do the same, and standardize these actions.
Encourage the G20 and the Financial Stability Board to develop a Task Force that would bring financial institutions together with multilateral and national development banks to finance clean energy and resilience projects in developing countries.
3. Protect national security, and ensure the safety of the world’s most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
Establish a precedent for supporting people permanently displaced by climate change by creating an entry point to apply for refugee status in the United States at a minimum.
Make funding clean energy and resilience a priority for U.S. development assistance programs in the President’s annual budget request.
Establish an Office of Climate Security in the White House to coordinate climate-related strategies in intelligence, defense, development and diplomacy, and will include civilian and military staff.
Lead a new council bringing together all research-focused federal agencies, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), to work together on RD challenges affecting the most vulnerable to climate change.
Put military bases at home and abroad on a path to self-sufficiency by improving the resilience of all infrastructure that the military relies on at home and abroad from the effects of climate change, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Align U.S. spending on RD with that of our allies to encourage cross-border collaboration on clean energy and resilience.
A Record on Climate Change:
As Mayor of New York City, Mike Bloomberg spearheaded PlaNYC – an unprecedented effort undertaken to combat climate change locally, bringing together over 25 City agencies to create a greener, greater New York. New York City planted more than 800,000 new trees, banned the use of the dirtiest heating oils, implemented the most aggressive mandatory energy efficiency program for large buildings in the United States, and instituted bus rapid transit lines as well as a major bike-sharing initiative. These efforts have reduced the city’s carbon footprint by 14% since 2005, and made New York City’s air cleaner than it has been in more than 50 years.
In 2010, he was elected Chair of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and as President of the Board. C40 is a network of large cities from around the world committed to implementing meaningful and sustainable climate-related actions locally that will help address climate change globally. Under his leadership, C40 adopted a new emphasis on accountability by establishing measurable and uniform benchmarks for success; expanding knowledge-sharing among cities; and demonstrating the potential cities have to achieve meaningful impact through research.

In 2014, he was appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to serve as Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change. In this role, Michael R. Bloomberg assisted the Secretary-General in his efforts to mobilize action among cities as part of a strategy to combat climate change. In 2018, Bloomberg’s title was changed to reflect his expansive work with not just cities, but states, regions, non-governmental organizations, businesses, and others, to combat climate change and drive our Paris Agreement goals. As UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ Special Envoy for Climate Action, he has become one of the world’s leading environmentalists through his public and private sector work to fight the growing threat of climate change.
Bloomberg has worked to involve the financial community in fighting climate change, serving as chair of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and formerly as chair of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. Both organizations give companies clear standards and recommendations to help guide their disclosures of climate-related risks and opportunities. At the UN Secretary-General’s request, he recently formed the Climate Finance Leadership Initiative with other influential private sector leaders to accelerate investments in clean energy and climate solutions.
Mike Bloomberg has taken on the coal industry to accelerate the transition to cleaner, cost-effective energy sources in the U.S. Prior to Trump taking office, this had brought U.S. emissions to their lowest level in 20 years, and a lower reliance on coal was cited as the main reason for the reduction.
His extensive work with U.S. cities on climate change includes the American Cities Climate Challenge, which provides cutting-edge support and expertise to help 25 of the largest U.S. cities reduce emissions from the buildings and transportation sectors. He also recently launched Beyond Carbon, the largest-ever coordinated campaign to fight the climate crisis in the U.S., which works to accelerate the retirement of coal plants and stop the construction of gas plants. The initiative brings his total investment in the global fight against climate change to $1 billion.
And, following a merger between the Bloomberg-founded Compact of Mayors and EU-founded European Covenant of Mayors, Bloomberg helped to form the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate  Energy (G-COM), an international alliance of over 10,000 cities and local governments, spanning over 130 countries and six continents, working to meet and exceed the Paris agreement objectives. Mike is the Co-Chair of the G-COM.
After President Trump announced his withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, Mike Bloomberg co-founded America’s Pledge with former California Governor Jerry Brown, galvanizing a coalition of nearly 4,000 cities, states, businesses, and organizations in a commitment to America’s climate goal. Since then, America’s Pledge has submitted the unofficial annual U.S. climate progress report to the United Nations and, for the past two years, Bloomberg Philanthropies has covered the funding gap created by the U.S. refusal to pay its share of the UN climate change budget.
