Global Climate Leadership
As the climate crisis worsens, President Trump has turned his back on the global community. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement. And he is determined to reverse the progress the Obama administration made in tackling climate change.
Mike will restore America’s leadership in fighting the global climate crisis. Mike’s first act as president will be to rejoin the Paris Agreement and commit the U.S. to leading by example and building the clean energy economy we need.
How Mike Will Get It Done:
Immediately rejoin the Paris Agreement
Make climate change a top priority of U.S. foreign policy
Protect our country from climate-related security risks
Keep the world’s most vulnerable people safe from the impacts of climate change
Mike’s Plan:
Immediately rejoin the Paris Agreement and re-establish US leadership
Mike’s first act as president will be to notify the United Nations that the U.S. will reenter the Paris Agreement. Mike will restore America’s global standing, leading by example with his ambitious plans to reduce U.S. carbon pollution 50% by 2030 and rallying other countries to raise their ambitions for global action. He will hold talks with the top-emitting countries to set stronger goals for reducing carbon pollution and for fulfilling responsibilities to help developing countries cope with climate change, and develop a plan for holding each other accountable for making progress.
Make climate change a top priority of U.S. foreign policy
Mike will use U.S. trade and security agreements to encourage other nations to develop and implement plans to reduce emissions. He will restore payments to the Green Climate Fund and make it a foreign-aid priority to help developing countries shift to affordable clean energy and strengthen their resilience to climate disasters. And he will work with other countries to end export subsidies for fossil fuels and hold other governments and corporations accountable for deforestation.
Mike will restore America’s leadership in fighting the global climate crisis.
Protect our country from climate-related security risks
Mike will establish an Office of Climate Security in the White House to coordinate climate-related strategies in intelligence, defense, development and diplomacy. He will strengthen military bases at home and abroad against the impacts of climate change and increase their use of clean energy for self-sufficiency. He will bring together research-focused federal agencies to collaborate on research into climate-related risks to U.S. national security and strategies for climate resilience.
Keep the world’s most vulnerable people safe from the impacts of climate change
Mike will support people permanently displaced by climate change by making it easier for them to apply for refugee status in the U.S. He will also fulfill U.S. commitments to work with other developed nations to help developing countries develop clean energy and strengthen their resilience to climate change impacts.
Mike Bloomberg, UN Special Envoy for Climate Action (2014-2019), speaks at the UN Climate Action Summit on September 23, 2019, in New York.
Mike’s Record:
Mike is a global leader in fighting the climate crisis.
After President Trump announced his withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, Mike co-founded America’s Pledge with former California Governor Jerry Brown, galvanizing a coalition of cities, states, businesses and organizations to continue America’s commitment to reducing emissions. Since then, America’s Pledge has submitted the unofficial annual U.S. climate progress report to the United Nations. And, for the past two years, Mike has stepped in to fill the funding gap for the UN Climate Change Secretariat left by the U.S. government.
In 2014, Mike was appointed UN Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change. In 2018, his title was changed to reflect his expansive work with not just cities but also states, regions, non-governmental organizations and businesses to combat climate change. Until late 2019, Mike was UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ Special Envoy for Climate Action.
In 2010, Mike was elected chair and president of the board of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. C40 is a network of international cities committed to acting locally to address climate change globally.
Mike also helped form the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate  Energy, a group of cities and local governments in over 130 countries that are working to meet and exceed the goals of the Paris Agreement. Mike is the co-chair of the Global Covenant.
Mike will lead America into a clean energy future.
