Maternal Health
Women are more likely to die in childbirth in the U.S. than in any other developed country. The crisis is growing worse, particularly for Black women. Each year, nearly 700 American women die from pregnancy or delivery complications, and the U.S. is one of 13 countries where maternal mortality rates are worse than they were two decades ago. Black women are over three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women. Under President Trump, more women lack access to critical health services, and the disparities in coverage are growing even more severe.
Mike will tackle our maternal mortality crisis head-on, with a particular focus on decreasing disparities for communities of color. He will expand access to maternal and reproductive health care, launch new efforts to reduce racial disparities in health care, and protect a woman’s right to choose.
How Mike Will Get It Done:
Require implicit bias training for doctors
Collect reliable data on maternal mortality
Ensure all low-income women can access health coverage
Boost funding for HBCU medical schools
Expand the National Health Service Corps
Encourage states to allow advanced practice nurses and physicians’ assistants to provide more care
Mike’s Plan:
Address racial bias
Mike will address bias in medicine – both implicit and explicit – by requiring doctors to complete training to understand and counter bias. Mike’s plan also boosts funding for medical schools at historically black colleges and universities to increase the number of people of color in the health care industry.
Standardize data
To address a lack of reliable data around maternal mortality, Mike’s plan centralizes data collection at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and uses the data to inform and improve standards of health care. The data will be used to establish programs to assist clinicians in identifying high-risk pregnancies.
Provide a public-option insurance plan —  free of charge
Mike’s plan will ensure that all low-income women can obtain health coverage in all 50 states. He will allow people in states that haven’t expanded Medicaid under the ACA, who would otherwise be eligible, to enroll in the public-option free of charge.
Support rural communities
Mike’s plan will bring more doctors to rural areas and encourage states to permit trained medical professionals to provide certain aspects of care that currently only doctors are allowed to provide — including maternal care. Mike will expand the National Health Service Corps, which offers loan repayment and scholarship opportunities for doctors who practice in high-need areas, to also cover medical students from minority communities.
Protect women’s right to choose
Mike will work with Congress to codify Roe v. Wade, guaranteeing legal access to safe abortion in all 50 states. He will also partner with Congress to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits using federal funds to pay for abortions except to save the life of the mother, or in cases of incest or rape. In addition, Mike pledges to abolish a new rule put into place by President Trump that bans Title X organizations from providing abortions (even if they are funded separately) and from referring patients to other abortion providers.
Women's health in this country is under attack, especially for African American women. It's time to get all women in the U.S. the resources and care they deserve. Here’s my plan to make sure that happens: https://t.co/c3bB1TapBg pic.twitter.com/a94KsHQgtu

Mike meets with maternal health experts and providers, Tennessee State Representative London Lamar, and Mayor Steven Reed and discusses his plans to address America's maternal health issues in Montgomery, Alabama on December 30, 2019.
America’s women are dying from preventable causes. And, for black women, the risk of dying from pregnancy is three-to-four times higher than it is for white women. Mike Bloomberg will work with Congress to expand access to reproductive health services for all Americans and ensure that practitioners can actually provide the services they are certified to perform. He’s going to make sure our mothers, sisters, and daughters get the health services they need so they and their babies can live longer, stronger lives.

Mike’s Record:
Improving maternal health has been a focus of Mike’s work as a mayor and a philanthropist.
As mayor, Mike adopted the Nurse-Family Partnership, a successful program that matches low-income first-time mothers with a nurse who visits the family in its home during pregnancy and the first couple years of parenthood.
New York City’s infant mortality rate fell to historic lows during Mike’s time in office, with a nearly 25 percent overall rate decline from 2001 to 2013, more than the national average.
Since 2012, his foundation has funded an innovative maternal health program in Tanzania. In 2014, Bloomberg Philanthropies partnered with Planned Parenthood Global to provide more women with access to reproductive health care and reduce maternal mortality in developing countries.
