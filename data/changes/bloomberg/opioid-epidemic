Tackling the Opioid Epidemic
As the opioid crisis continues to devastate families across our country, President Trump’s response has been an embarrassment. Since he took office, opioid overdoses have continued to kill more Americans every year than car crashes.
Mike has been working to combat the opioid crisis for many years—and he will continue that work as president. Mike will make medications for addiction treatment more accessible, expand access to mental health care, collect better data on opioid use and overdoses, and then use that data to end this epidemic once and for all.
Make medications for addiction treatment more accessible
Expand access to health services
Require insurance coverage of mental health care
Collect better data on opioid use and overdoses
Mike’s Plan:
Aggressively combat the opioid crisis
Mike will make sure that people who need treatment get it when they enter hospitals or the criminal justice system. That means ensuring hospitals are equipped to provide medications for opioid use disorder — and treating people who suffer from addiction problems instead of incarcerating them, unless they have committed violent crimes.
Require insurance coverage for mental health care
Mike believes health care is a right, and that includes mental health care. That’s why he will make sure federal laws mandating insurance coverage for mental health and substance use disorders are enforced — so no American struggles to afford the care they need.
Every day, an average of 130 Americans die from an opioid overdose. Each one is someone's son, daughter, brother, sister, or loved one. This is an epidemic and a national emergency - and we must respond accordingly. Here’s what I plan to do about it: https://t.co/zcbsqiEesF pic.twitter.com/NT4LC7pex9

Remove unnecessary obstacles
Mike will remove the obstacles that insurers have put in place to make it more difficult to access medications used to treat opioid use disorder. He will get rid of policies mandating prior authorization for the use of medications and eliminate special training requirements and limits on prescribing buprenorphine.
Collect better data
Mike always says, “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.” That’s why he will develop national standards for states to gather data on opioid use and overdoses. That’s how they will better understand the scope of the crisis. It’s how they’ll identify what help is needed. And it’s how they’ll end this epidemic.
Mike Bloomberg meets with Mayor Luke Feeney and attends a roundtable to hear from community members about the effects of the opioid epidemic. Chillicothe, Ohio on December 20, 2019.
Mike’s Record:
Mike Bloomberg has a proven track record of addressing the opioid epidemic and, as president, will take urgent action to deal with this crisis.
As mayor, Mike formed the Prescription Painkiller Abuse Task Force. He also created NYC RxStat, which combined and used public health and public safety data to fight prescription drug abuse. And he restricted the prescription of powerful painkillers in the emergency rooms of New York City’s public hospitals to combat prescription drug abuse. More recently, as a philanthropist, Mike Bloomberg has charged his foundation with addressing the epidemic and saving lives. In total, Bloomberg Philanthropies has committed to giving more than $50 million to combat opioid addiction and strengthen treatment programs.
