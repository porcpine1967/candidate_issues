Paid Family Leave
Mike believes every worker in America deserves access to paid family leave. As president, Mike will require employers to give twelve weeks of paid family leave whenever a child arrives, or to care for a child, spouse or parent with a serious medical condition.  But today, while American workers can take time off from work to care for their families, more than 80% of workers in the private sector aren’t paid during that period. Donald Trump promised to deliver paid family leave, but his plan is an empty shell which forces workers to withdraw from future benefits like social security, leaving them vulnerable in their retirement. As president, Mike will ensure paid family leave for all Americans.
How Mike Will Get It Done:
Guarantee 12 weeks of paid family leave
Ensure all workers, regardless of gender or income, can take leave
Protect workers from retaliation for taking leave
Mike’s Plan:
Guarantee 12 weeks of paid family leave.
Mike’s plan delivers on what Trump has promised and failed to do. Mike will secure 12 weeks of paid family leave for all workers by passing the FAMILY Act.
Ensure all workers, regardless of gender or income, can take leave.
Mike’s plan makes access to paid family leave equitable, gender neutral and available to workers of all incomes. Today, women are far more likely than men to not work outside the home, a sign of growing pressures on women to provide primary child care. Separately, workers with lower wages are less likely to have access to paid family leave.
Stand with Mike on the issues to help defeat Donald Trump and get big things done.
Protect workers from retaliation.
Mike’s plan enforces anti-retaliation protections for workers who take paid family leave. For example, under Mike, employers will be prevented from denying workers professional opportunities for taking legally-permitted time off to care for loved ones.
