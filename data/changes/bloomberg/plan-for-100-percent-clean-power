100% Clean Power
The power plants that generate our electricity were for many years the biggest source of pollution that causes climate change and serious health problems like asthma and heart conditions. Their pollution has dropped in recent years, in one of the biggest success stories in the fight against climate change — the shift from coal power to cleaner sources of energy, a change Mike Bloomberg has helped accomplish.
We need to build on this progress. But rather than move forward, President Trump has doubled down on his support for the fossil fuel industry. Mike will propel the United States toward a 100% clean energy future with a plan for 80% of electricity nationwide to come from clean sources by the end of his second term. Mike will boost investment in clean energy to move us toward 100% clean energy as soon as possible.
How Mike Will Get It Done:
Accelerate the use of clean energy to replace power from fossil fuels as soon as possible
Implement limits on air and water pollution from power plants 
Invest in communities that have felt the greatest impact from coal pollution or the transition to a clean energy economy
Quadruple the federal RD investment in clean energy, and end all subsidies for fossil fuels
Mike’s Plan:
Accelerate the use of clean energy to replace power from fossil fuels as soon as possible
Mike will extend tax incentives for clean energy and energy storage. He will create new incentives to help low-income families afford clean energy. Mike will work with Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to develop a 100% clean energy standard, energy efficiency standards, and a smart power grid. He also will work with state and local governments to accelerate the construction of transmission and clean energy projects, including offshore and on federal lands previously used for fossil fuel extraction.

Implement limits on air and water pollution from power plants
Mike also will reverse Trump’s rollbacks of environmental rules and put in place aggressive standards for carbon and other air pollution from coal and gas plants. He will reinstate and strengthen President Obama’s rules to limit water pollution from hazardous coal waste sites.
Invest in communities that have felt the greatest impacts of coal pollution or the transition to clean energy
Low-income communities, tribal communities and communities of color have suffered from fossil fuel pollution, and workers in the fossil fuel industry are being left behind in the transition to clean energy. Mike will make sure those most affected by pollution have access to clean energy and the jobs that come with it. He will prioritize supporting coal plant workers and their communities, making sure they get promised health and retirement benefits. He will offer incentives to develop new infrastructure in affected communities, make sure new jobs are good jobs and encourage priority access to jobs for affected workers. Mike also will help affected communities diversify their economies.
Quadruple the federal RD investment in clean energy, and end all subsidies for fossil fuels
Mike will increase federal investment in clean energy RD to at least $25 billion a year, prioritizing storage and grid technologies, as well as sectors of the economy that are hardest to decarbonize. He will cut off subsidies and close tax loopholes for coal, oil and gas.
Mike will propel the United States toward a 100% clean energy future.

Mike’s Record:
Mike has a proven track record in cutting emissions in the power sector.
Mike helped launch the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign in 2011. The campaign so far has succeeded in closing over half of America’s coal-fired power plants. In 2019, Mike founded Beyond Carbon, the largest-ever campaign to fight climate change in the United States. Beyond Carbon is supporting the elected officials and citizens leading this fight and activating voters to accelerate America’s transition to a 100% clean energy future.
