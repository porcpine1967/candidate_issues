Political Reform
Fixing Washington
Mike has always been independent from special interests – he has never accepted campaign contributions – and has worked to eliminate the corrosive power of money in politics. As president, Mike will clean up the mess in Washington by making political reform a top priority. He’ll work with Congress to overhaul the campaign finance system, stop pay-to-play, bring transparency to dark money, strengthen ethics and regulations around conflicts of interest, and improve access to the ballot – all of which he succeeded in doing as mayor of New York City.
Mike’s Record on Political Reform
Mike expanded public financing of elections in New York City by increasing the matching rate for small donations from $4 to $6, which meant that a $25 donation resulted in a $150 public match.
Mike cracked down on pay-to-play by drastically limiting campaign contributions from individuals and entities that did business with government.
Mike supported passage of a law that required spending in referendum campaigns to be publicly disclosed.
Mike strengthened the New York City’s ethics and conflicts of interest laws and forced lobbyists to disclose their contacts with city officials.
Mike made it easier to register to vote, created a web- and video-based voter guide, and supported efforts to allow voting on weekends.
