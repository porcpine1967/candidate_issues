Mike’s Plan
Mike’s Plan to ensure the economic security and health needs of veterans includes:
Addressing high suicide rates and mental illness
According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, an estimated 17 veterans die each day by suicide.
Mike will bring the crisis into the open, to educate the public and reduce the stigma surrounding suicide, and as president, he will tirelessly tackle the veterans mental health epidemic.
Mike will increase access to mental health services through public-private partnerships, ease credentialing to increase the number of providers, provide annual mental health exams for active -duty servicemembers, educate those leaving the service on mental illness and gun safety, and increase funding for mental health across the VA.
Improving access to care for all military veterans
Nationwide, 25% of all veterans and 41% veterans that served active duty at any time since September 11 have a service-connected disability.
Mike will eliminate co pays for preventative health care services, expand rural veterans’ access to telehealth services and increase access and funding to disability and mental health services.

Ensuring the medical needs of the growing number of servicewomen and female vets are met
Women make up roughly 10%-20% of the military and represent the fastest-growing demographic in recruiting.
Mike will ensure that military deployments won’t limit servicemembers’ ability to have a family.
Mike will provide resources to cover IVF and other fertility services for those who need it.
Mike will ensure that providers are trained to address women’s particular needs and gender-specific care is available at all VA medical facilities. Mike will expand the availability of childcare by subsidizing efforts at local childcare centers and expanding after-hours care at on-base childcare centers.
Addressing sexual assault and harassment
Sexual assault, especially perpetrated against female soldiers, is on the rise across the U.S. military, with 20,500 instances of “unwanted sexual contact” reported in the 2018 fiscal year.
Mike will require people across the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to be trained to handle reported sexual assault and harassment and provide care.
Mike will give victims of sexual assault and harassment the option of using an independent military prosecutor to ensure their cases are prosecuted appropriately, while subjecting any command prosecution decisions to independent review.
Addressing the veterans homelessness epidemic
After declining dramatically during President Obama’s administration, the number of homeless veterans has remained at around 37,000 nationwide.
Mike will bring security and dignity to homeless veterans by making necessary investments that will put veterans in homes.
Mike will fully fund the federal government’s HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program, expedite the hiring of VA administrators to process applications for an additional 6,000 veterans, and provide block grants to cities to build transitional-housing communities with wraparound services for veterans.

Undoing President Trump’s discriminatory rhetoric and practices and rolling back lingering effects of the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy
Prior to the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” more than 100,000 veterans were discharged solely on the basis of being LGBTQ+. Today, while structural prejudices remain for LGBTQ+ servicemembers, the Trump administration has blocked transgender soldiers from serving openly.
Mike will reverse President Trump’s ban on transgender Americans.
Mike will grant an honorable discharge to servicemembers who were forced out under the earlier policy.
Protecting veterans and their families from deportation
Military members are now denied citizenship at a higher rate than civilians.
Mike will protect military families from the threat of deportation.
Mike will provide servicemembers with a fast track to naturalization.
Ensuring economic security for military families
33% of veterans are underemployed, meaning they work in jobs that do not require their full education.
Mike will expand technical training for servicemembers in high-demand fields like computer science.
Mike will make it easier to translate the technical certifications earned while serving into civilian credentials.
Mike will create Centers of Excellence and Empowerment where ex-servicemembers and companies can learn how best to take advantage of the unique experiences of veterans and their families.
