Veterans
President Trump has repeatedly demeaned and disrespected our military leaders and Gold Star families. Our servicemembers and veterans deserve a Commander in Chief who will make sure our heroes receive the respect and support they’ve earned: real economic opportunity, a smooth transition from military life to civilian life, job training and contacts, mental and physical health care, fertility services, and more. Mike understands the sacrifices our veterans have made and their potential to grow our economy and strengthen our communities.
How Mike Will Get It Done:
Educate companies about the skills veterans possess and link veterans to jobs
Help veterans draft plans and access financing to launch businesses
Improve access to care for all veterans
Improve mental health and address high rates of suicide 
Combat military sexual assault and harassment
Reduce veteran homelessness
Protect veterans and their families from deportation
Mike’s Plan:
Ensure economic security for veterans and military families
Mike’s plan will expand technical training for service members in high-demand fields like computer science, make it easier to translate the technical certifications earned while serving into civilian credentials and will create Centers of Excellence and Empowerment where veterans and companies can connect.
Members of the military and our veterans deserve respect. Mike will make sure they get the support, services and opportunities they’ve earned.
Improve access to care for all military veterans
Mike will eliminate co-pays for preventative health care services, expand rural veterans’ access to telemedicine services, reduce the disability claims backlog and increase access to and funding for mental health services.
Meet the needs of female vets
Mike will ensure that providers are trained to address women’s particular needs at all VA medical facilities and expand the availability of childcare. Mike’s plan also will ensure that military deployments won’t limit servicemembers’ ability to have a family and will provide resources to cover IVF and other fertility services for those who need it.
Address the veteran homelessness epidemic
Mike will bring security and dignity to homeless veterans and put veterans in homes by fully funding the federal government’s HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program, expediting the hiring of case managers to process applications for an additional 6,000 veterans and provide block grants to cities to build transitional-housing communities with wraparound services for veterans.
Address high suicide rates and mental illness
Mike’s plan will increase funding for mental health across the VA, broaden access to mental health services through public-private partnerships, ease credentialing to increase the number of providers, provide annual mental health exams for active-duty servicemembers, and educate those leaving the service on mental illness and gun safety.
Combat sexual assault and harassment
Mike will require staff across the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to be trained to handle reported sexual assault and harassment and provide care.
Mike will give victims of sexual assault the option of using an independent military prosecutor to ensure their cases are prosecuted appropriately, while subjecting all command prosecution decisions to independent review.

Protect veterans and their families from deportation
Mike will protect military families from the threat of deportation and provide immigrant servicemembers with a fast track to naturalization.
