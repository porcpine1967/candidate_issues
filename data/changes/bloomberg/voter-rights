Voter Rights
The right to vote is under attack. Voter ID restrictions, unwarranted purges, gerrymandering, and other voter interference efforts are undermining our democracy. Mike will put an end to this rampant disenfranchisement by expanding access to the ballot box, preventing states from excluding African-Americans and other minorities, and creating national protections that increase voter access.
How Mike Will Get It Done:
Reinvigorate the Voting Rights Act
Prevent voter suppression
End partisan gerrymandering
Make it easier to register
Make it more convenient to vote
Upgrade and standardize voting machines and ballots
Mike’s Plan:
Protect voting rights for all Americans
Mike will change practices that make it more difficult for Black and Latino voters, Native Americans, transgender people, the elderly, those in rural areas, and people with disabilities to vote. He’ll end voter suppression by banning unwarranted voter purges. Mike will establish a new Voting Rights Act formula for determining pre-clearance requirements for certain jurisdictions in order to stop discriminatory voting laws before they are enacted.
Prevent gerrymandering and eliminate partisan influence in elections
Mike will create a uniform, transparent, and inclusive districting process that will require states to establish independent redistricting commissions when drawing federal congressional districts. This is especially important for communities of color, who have long been disenfranchised by unfair, partisan redistricting.
Make it easy for all eligible voters to cast their ballots
Mike will make it simpler to vote by implementing uniform standards for federal elections across states, requiring policies like automatic voter registration and early voting, and ensuring the availability and accessibility of polling places.
Modernize election infrastructure so our elections are safe and secure
Mike will upgrade election infrastructure and protect the integrity of our federal elections by mandating the use of state-of-the-art voting machines, providing training and technical assistance for election officials, and requiring the Department of Homeland Security to assess threats prior to elections.
Restore voting rights to convicted felons after they’ve served their time
Mike will restore full voting rights to felons who have served their sentences. These rights will be restored upon release. Pre-trial detainees will also be allowed to register and vote. States will no longer be permitted to use fines, fees, or other impediments to delay restoration of voting rights after a person is released from prison.
Mike believes that every vote counts and that the integrity of our elections must be secured.
Mike’s Record:
As mayor of New York City, Mike proposed sweeping reforms to make voting easier for New Yorkers, including early voting, easier voter registration, and “no-excuse” absentee voting. He also advocated for nonpartisan elections to increase competition in local elections.
As a philanthropist, Mike has supported voting rights. He has also condemned President Trump’s embrace of foreign election interference.
