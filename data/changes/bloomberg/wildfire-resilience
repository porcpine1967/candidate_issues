Wildfire Resilience
Intensifying wildfires cause billions of dollars of damage and threaten the safety of too many Americans each year, especially people living in rural communities in Western states. Wildfires also contribute to climate change by releasing more carbon into the atmosphere. President Trump hasn’t done nearly enough to address this growing crisis.
Mike will lead a national effort to protect our communities from wildfires and prevent them from breaking out in the first place. He will make wildfire resilience a top priority of the U.S. Forest Service. He also will create a national Wildfire Corps that will lead efforts to make communities more fire-resilient, restore healthy forest ecosystems, and help fight fires when they do break out.
How Mike Will Get It Done:
Make wildfire resilience a top priority of the U.S. Forest Service
Double federal funding for fire management
Create a new Wildfire Corps to make communities more fire-resilient and restore healthy forest ecosystems
Use data and technology to detect and mitigate fires
Mike’s Plan:
Make wildfire resilience a top priority of the U.S. Forest Service
Mike will set a goal to reduce deaths and property losses from wildfires by 50% within four years. He will direct the U.S. Forest Service to coordinate with federal, state and local agencies, tribal leaders, environmental groups, rural communities, private timber companies, utilities, and the insurance industry to develop fire management plans for each state at risk.
Double federal funding for fire management
Mike will double federal funding for fire management to $10 billion and devote half to mitigation efforts. These new resources will fund efforts to rapidly increase the pace and scale of forest restoration, reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires. Federal money will also be directed to help fireproof homes and communities, develop evacuation plans, and strengthen other local resilience efforts, which will save lives, create jobs, reduce the costs and dangers of firefighting, and bolster insurance networks.
Create a national Wildfire Corps to make communities more fire-resilient and restore healthy forest ecosystems
Mike will create a national Wildfire Corps, a new partnership between federal, tribal, state and local governments and communities. The Corps will hire and train thousands of workers to lead efforts to make communities more fire-resilient and restore healthy forest ecosystems. It also will provide enough firefighters to quickly contain wildfires when they break out.
Use data and technology to detect and mitigate fires
Mike will partner with state authorities to use satellites, aircraft, and new technology to help detect fires faster and more cheaply, predict the spread of fires, and improve firefighting techniques. He will refine and constantly update national fire-risk maps that local officials can use to assess risk and plan for future wildfires.
Mike will lead a national effort to protect our communities from wildfires and prevent them from breaking out in the first place.
Mike’s Record:
Mike has a long record of fighting climate change and making communities more resilient against climate-related harms.
Through Bloomberg Philanthropies’ American Cities Climate Challenge, Mike partnered with 25 American cities to accelerate their efforts to address climate change.
As mayor of New York City, Mike navigated extreme weather events and invested in climate resilience – making the city safer from the inevitable effects of climate change. He launched a $20 billion resilience and rebuilding initiative to minimize flood risk, reinforce the city’s critical infrastructure against storm and climate risk, and bolster telecommunications systems. He updated building codes to account for climate-related threats, including flooding and extreme heat, and committed more than $6 million, with another $4 million in matching funds, to a public-private neighborhood green infrastructure program.
Mike will lead America into a clean energy future.
