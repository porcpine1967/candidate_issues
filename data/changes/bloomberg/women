Women for Mike
Mike Bloomberg is an experienced leader who gets things done on the issues that matter most to women. As an entrepreneur, a philanthropist, and mayor of New York, Mike has long supported advancing gender equality, maternal and reproductive health, and women’s economic development both in the U.S. and around the world.
He has a strong record of supporting and empowering women throughout his career — from hiring women to the very top positions in his mayoral administration to supporting women candidates for higher office to instituting an industry-leading 26-weeks of paid family leave at his company.
Mike is committed to advancing an inclusive agenda for women when he gets to the White House. Learn why women across America are standing with Mike.
