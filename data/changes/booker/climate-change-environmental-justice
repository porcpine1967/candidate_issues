Climate Change and Environmental Justice
Our planet is in crisis. Climate change is not some distant threat — we’re witnessing many of its effects today. And the immediate burden of much of the pollution causing climate change is disproportionately borne by low-income communities and communities of color.
As president, Cory will take immediate steps to combat climate change, and protect and defend all communities affected by pollution and environmental injustice:
Rejoin the Paris Climate Accord.
Undo the damage the Trump Administration has done at the Environmental Protection Agency and hold polluters accountable.
Work to implement a Green New Deal.
Put a moratorium on drilling on our public lands.
Reauthorize and triple the Superfund tax on chemical and oil companies.
Increase fees on coal mine operators to pay for the cleanup of abandoned mines.
Protect marginalized communities suffering from environmental injustices by increasing staffing at the EPA’s Environmental Justice Office and the External Civil Rights Enforcement Office.
Step up efforts to defend communities of color, low-income communities, and indigenous communities by doubling staffing in all EPA enforcement offices.
Safeguard the basic human right to safe drinking water.
End the plague on communities caused by lead paint.
Stop polluting companies from evading responsibility for environmental cleanups.
Raise the standards for granting or renewing Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act Permits.
Ban fracking.
Reinstate and expand the crude oil export ban.
Require consideration of climate change impacts in permitting decisions for any new fossil fuel infrastructure.
Prohibit construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure when cost competitive clean energy alternatives are available.
End all federal subsidies for fossil fuel production.
