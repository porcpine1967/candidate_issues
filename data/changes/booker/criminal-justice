Criminal Justice
America’s justice system is deeply broken — it treats you better, as Bryan Stevenson says, if you’re rich and guilty than if you’re poor and innocent. The United States is home to only 5% of the world’s population, but 25% of the world’s incarcerated people — disproportionately people of color. For decades, this broken system has hollowed out entire communities, wasted billions of taxpayer dollars, and failed to make us safer.
As president, Cory will fight to end the War on Drugs, implement bold and comprehensive reforms of our criminal justice system, and pursue restorative justice:
Decriminalize marijuana, expunge records, and restore justice to individuals and communities that have been devastated by the War on Drugs.
Extend clemency to individuals serving excessive sentences for nonviolent drug offenses.
Eliminate the racially-targeted sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine.
End harsh mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenses.
Improve the ability of those behind bars to stay in touch with their loved ones.
Reinvest in the communities most impacted by the failed War on Drugs.
Remove barriers to employment for people with criminal convictions by “banning the box” and making it easier to receive occupational licenses.
Reinstate the right to vote in federal elections for formerly incarcerated individuals.
Provide better training for law enforcement officers on implicit racial bias, de-escalation and use-of-force.
Prohibit racial and religious profiling and improve the reporting of police use-of-force incidents.
Restoring Justice
We can't be timid.
