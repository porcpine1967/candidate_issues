Get big money out of politics by ending Citizens United.
Restore the original Voting Rights Act that was gutted by the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder.

End gerrymandering.
End voter suppression.
Ensure universal automatic voter registration and vote by mail.
Restore voting rights for formerly incarcerated people.
Ensure all voters are able to vote in a language they understand.
