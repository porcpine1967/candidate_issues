Immigration
Our immigration system is broken, and the Trump Administration’s inhumane policies stand in stark contrast to everything we say we stand for as a country.
As president, Cory will work to fix our broken immigration system and ensure that America once again becomes a beacon of freedom, hope, and opportunity to the world for generations to come:
End family separation and ensure that our immigration system is humane, fair, and respects immigrants’ rights by ending private detention facilities and not treating immigrants who cross our border seeking safety as criminals.
Create an asylum process that recognizes the dignity of those who have taken extraordinary risks to seek safe haven in our country.
Expand protections for DREAMers and people with Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure.
Fight for a pathway to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the United States.
