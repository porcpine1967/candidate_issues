Veterans
We call ourselves the home of the brave, but we are not doing nearly enough to support and honor our brave veterans. Veterans are disproportionately represented in our criminal justice system and are more likely to experience homelessness. Too often they lack access to the health care services they need and deserve.
As president, Cory will fight for veterans’ access to health care, education and good-paying jobs:
Strengthen economic opportunities for veterans, including those seeking to start small businesses.
Ensure world class health care, including mental health services, that is accessible and easy to navigate.
Pass the Veteran Education and Transfer Extension Act to fill in gaps in veterans’ higher education benefits.
Ensure the Veterans Health Administration provides gender-inclusive and accessible services.
