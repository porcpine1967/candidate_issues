Veterans and Military Families
We call ourselves the home of the brave, but we are not doing nearly enough to support and honor our brave veterans. Veterans are disproportionately represented in our criminal justice system and are more likely to experience homelessness. Too often they lack access to the health care services they need and deserve.
As president, Cory will fight for veterans’ access to health care, education and good-paying jobs:
Strengthen economic opportunities for veterans, including those seeking to start small businesses by directing the Small Business Administration to invest more in veteran-owned businesses and entrepreneurship.
Ensure world class health care, including mental health services, that is accessible and easy to navigate.
Pass the Veteran Education and Transfer Extension Act to fill in gaps in veterans’ higher education benefits.
Ensure the Veterans Health Administration provides gender-inclusive and accessible services, including access to gynecologists and obstetricians, sexual counselors, therapists, and other medical personnel.
End veteran homelessness through major new investment in evidence-based programs to find, keep safe, and move back into housing anyone in need.
Appoint a White House official solely focused on coordinating across federal agencies to cut the suicide rate among veterans.
