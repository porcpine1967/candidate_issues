Equality for LGBTQ People
Despite the progress that has been made, LGBTQ Americans are still not fully protected by civil rights and anti-discrimination law.
As president, Cory will fight to ensure that all LGBTQ people have full protections of federal civil rights law and the federal government:
Champion the Equality Act, which ensures that federal civil rights laws prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
Immediately end the ban on transgender servicemembers from serving in the military.
Rescind the Trump Administration’s “refusal rules” that allow people to be denied necessary health care because of a provider’s personal beliefs.
