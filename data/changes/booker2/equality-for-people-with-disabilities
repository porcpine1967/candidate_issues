Equality for People with Disabilities
Itâ€™s been nearly 30 years since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, but people with disabilities still face higher rates of poverty, are overrepresented in our criminal justice system, and must overcome other barriers to health care and quality of life.
As president, Cory will work to ensure accessibility, equality, and opportunity for all people with disabilities:
Break down barriers to accessing employment, transportation, housing, and health care with the Disability Integration Act.
Fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).
Raise wages for people with disabilities by phasing out the subminimum wage.
