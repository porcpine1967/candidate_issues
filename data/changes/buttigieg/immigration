Immigration is central to the American story, and we see that story written in communities large and small across the United States. My hometown of South Bend is a city with a history of diverse immigrant communities—from the French fur trappers who came here in the 1800s, to the German and Polish immigrants who labored in the Studebaker factories, to more recently arrived Mexican, Honduran, Burmese, and Cameroonian immigrants who have helped transform our city into what it is today. The immigrant tradition of our community even includes my own father, who came to America from Malta for education opportunities and then became an American citizen.
Millions have come to America to seek opportunity and contribute their chapter in this great tradition. Others are pushed to come by circumstances beyond their control. We are a nation built on dreams of freedom and democracy—and also created through dispossession, enslavement, conquest, and colonialism. Whatever drives people to move across borders—opportunity, conflict, climate change, economic insecurity—we must welcome the stranger and respect the dignity of every person.

We are called by many different ethical and religious traditions to treat each person with compassion, not cruelty. We get to choose what kind of country we live in—that is the foundation of American democracy. We can continue to cause pain and suffering to families and communities, and to hurt our economy in the process. Or we can choose to protect and protest on behalf of our community members, whether it be neighbors protecting neighbors in NashvilleFarzan, Antonia Noori. “We Stuck Together like Neighbors Are Supposed to Do: A Community Thwarts a Fathers ICE Arrest.” The Washington Post.

Our policies should acknowledge that immigrants are not outsiders. They are already members of our communities. Immigrants are labor organizers and artists. They are business owners and teachers. They are caregivers and health care providers. They serve in our military. They are activists and students. They are every race, class, religion, gender, and sexual orientation. They are our parents, spouses, neighbors, and friends.
My plan has four components:
Promote belonging and democracy.
Modernize our immigration system.
Protect the border and the people who arrive there.
Engage with the global community.
