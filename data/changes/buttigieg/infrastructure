Infrastructure is essential to our daily lives. In principle, excellent infrastructure enables our communities to thrive. For example, parents can make their kid’s soccer game or get home in time for dinner rather than sitting in traffic for hours. Everyone has safe drinking water and breathes clean air. Cities and towns invest in parks, modern school buildings, and streets that support local jobs and attract businesses and families. State-of-the-art airports, public transit, highways, waterways, and railways enable people to travel safely and goods to get to market. And high-speed Internet supports new industries and connects friends and family across the world.
Yet over the last four years, politicians in Washington have failed to deliver for the American people. The current administration has been incapable of keeping its promise to pass major infrastructure legislation, and critical projects around the country are stalled because of it. Meanwhile, our roads and bridges crumble, our schools fall into disrepair, water systems poison our children, and our flood protection systems fail as climate change accelerates. When our infrastructure works well, we hardly notice. These days, we notice our infrastructure a lot.
In communities across America, we know that investments in infrastructure create well-paying jobs and provide essential services like water and transportation that help us raise families and start businesses. This is why cities and towns have been leading the way on new infrastructure partnerships and approaches. Yet too often, as I saw in South Bend, the federal government does not help as it should—by failing to fund and prioritize infrastructure or by relying on outdated standards.
Under my administration, local governments will finally have a partner in Washington. As a former mayor, I know that priority-based budgets made locally are better than budget-based priorities set in Washington. That’s why we will ensure that federal funds go to the cities, counties, tribes, towns, and states that need more resources to create good jobs and combat climate change through smart infrastructure investments.
My infrastructure plan achieves three things: opportunity, equity, and empowerment. First, we will create opportunities for individuals and communities, including millions of well-paying union jobs. Second, we will close disparities and ensure that everyone has access to adequate infrastructure like clean drinking water and affordable ways to get to work. Finally, we will empower local communities to lead on infrastructure development so that they can support safe, vibrant, growing neighborhoods.
My administration will invest over $1 trillion in working with states, cities, and other local governments to build the sustainable infrastructure of the 21st century. We will achieve measurable outcomes for opportunity, equity, and empowerment:
Create six million well-paying jobs with strong labor protections, especially in underrepresented communities.
Ensure that every American has access to clean drinking water.
Lower water bills nationwide, slashing the average bill by 50 percent–the equivalent of over $600–for 10 million families.
Protect millions of families from lead in paint and water through a $100 billion investment.
Update and fix the majority of our roads and bridges in poor condition by 2030.
Invest in sustainable infrastructure that enables 50 percent of U.S. counties to grow over the next 10 years, as measured by an increase in jobs, businesses, or population.

Stalled Infrastructure Projects in South Carolina
Bridges: A bridge on state road 20 in Greenville County has been shut for repairs since late 2018. It was supposed to be finished in March 2019, but the new target completion date is now April 2020. https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/south-carolina/2019/05/03/sc-20-bridge-project-greenville-county/3627745002/Key policy: Pete’s plan will create a $50 billion bridge repair program to ensure that critical and delayed bridge repairs have the resources they need.
Struggling small water systems: More than 150 small drinking water systems in SC have had multiple Department of Health cases against them in the past twenty-five years, with most systems facing only small fines for providing unclean water. https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article228530804.htmlKey policy: Pete’s plan invests $90 billion in water, which means more than tripling the current amount of federal investment. This will help to fund upgrades for outdated infrastructure and water cleanup.
Lead in water: In the past decade, 41 small utility companies in SC have exceeded federal standards for lead in their water, including Belton, SC in 2019 - highlighting the need for improvements to these systems. https://www.thestate.com/news/special-reports/article224593265.htmlKey policy: Pete is investing $20 billion in replacing lead pipes and helping utilities with corrosion control, so lead does not leach into water.
Flood protection: Hurricanes in recent years have also caused damage to many of the state’s dams - such as the dozen dams which collapsed during Hurricane Florence. https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/article218982240.htmlKey policy: Pete will establish a new $50 billion Community Flood Protection to help states repair dams and levees and develop natural infrastructure solutions.

Stalled Infrastructure Projects in Nevada
Urban/rural divide: NV faces a $450 million backlog of road and bridge repairs, disproportionately concentrated in rural areas. This costs Nevada drivers $3.2 billion annually. Experts point to a severe disparity between the infrastructure needs of NV’s two densely populated areas and its ~15 rural counties. https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ASCE-Report-Card-2018-Final.pdfKey policy: Pete’s plan will ensure that 50% of critical road repairs occur by 2030. He will create a $50 billion bridge repair program with dedicated funding available for rural areas.
Water: The EPA estimates that NV will need over $5.3 billion in investment over the next 20 years to meet the state’s clean water needs. Las Vegas and Reno will need investment to accommodate their rapidly growing populations, and NV’s rural areas have historically lacked resources and funding to meet their water needs.Ibid.Key policy: Pete will invest over $30 billion in water infrastructure. This is a massive expansion of resources for upgrading existing water infrastructure and finding innovative approaches to improve wastewater services.
Rural schools: Like much of NV’s infrastructure landscape, the state’s rural school districts suffer from chronic underfunding and neglect. For example, two of the 10 school buildings in White Pine County are over a century old.Ibid.Key policy: Pete will create an $80 billion school repair program.

Stalled Infrastructure Projects in California
Public transit in San Francisco: BART (San Francisco’s subway system) applied for federal funding to expand its capacity in August 2015. In May 2019, it called on the federal government to release $1.25 billion of money from the Capital Investment Grant Program. The project was delayed by Trump’s DOT for over a year. https://www.masstransitmag.com/rail/infrastructure/article/21083363/barts-crunican-we-cant-wait-any-longer-our-system-is-already-at-capacityKey policy: Pete will double the size of the Capital Investment Grant program and streamline project processing to ensure that projects get federal support faster.
Lead: About 2,000 children are diagnosed with unsafe levels of lead in their blood each year in Los Angeles County, likely due to old homes that have not been renovated. https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-12-30/la-me-lead-poisoning-la-countyKey policy: Pete will invest $80 billion in lead remediation for paint, windows, and soil in homes. He will enforce the Lead Repair, Replacement, and Painting rule to ensure that any renovations are done using lead-safe procedures.
