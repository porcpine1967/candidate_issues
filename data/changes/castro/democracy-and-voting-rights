Democracy and Voting Rights
I believe in an America where everyone counts. That means fighting for a democracy that represents the will of the people. Not super PACs, not big corporations, not corrupt politicians, but everyday Americans.
When I’m president, we will return power to the people.
Supporting voter rights:
Abolish the Electoral College, affirming the equal value of each person’s vote
Support self-determination for the people of Puerto Rico
Enact statehood for Washington D.C.
Lower the voting age to 17
Combat gerrymandering with independent redistricting commissions
Restore voting rights to people who have served their time
Expand automatic voter registration, early and absentee voting, and satellite voting stations
Make Election Day a federal holiday
Reverse voter ID laws
Strengthen the Voting Rights Act, including restoring pre-clearance requirement
Combatting money in politics:
Repeal Citizens United with a constitutional amendment
Advocate for federally-funded elections with small dollar donation matching
Supporting transparency:
Expand the Freedom of Information Act to include your representatives in Congress and expedite the time it takes to provide the needed information
Join me in calling for these reforms for our democracy by signing your name here.
