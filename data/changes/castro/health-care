Health Care
Health care is a human right. In the wealthiest nation on Earth, we will finally guarantee high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans.
When I’m president, we will achieve Medicare for all by strengthening Medicare for those who have it and make it available for all.
Medicare for All
Strengthen Medicare for those who have it, and expand it to achieve universal healthcare coverage by including all Americans within the program.
Allow individuals to obtain supplementary private insurance or opt-out of Medicare if they have a high-standard private insurance plan through an employer or organization that is regulated under the Affordable Care Act
Ensure all Americans will have health care coverage at all times at a lower cost to themselves
Enroll newborns and anyone who loses employer-sponsored insurance immediately into Medicare so that all Americans are insured at all times
Combine other publicly-run health programs, such as Medicaid, into one Medicare program. The Indian Health Service and the Veterans Affairs system would continue to offer their unique services to support Tribal communities and veterans, and would be supplemented by Medicare.
End the distinction between physical and mental health and require all insurance plans and publicly-run programs to cover mental healthcare
Lower prescription drug costs
Empower Medicare to negotiate drug prices using international prices as a reference point
Reform intellectual property laws to promote generic drugs
Allow the import of drugs from countries that meet strong consumer protection and safety standards
Invest in rural and underserved communities to expand health care access
Implement universal coverage through Medicare and investing in rural hospitals
Increase reimbursement rates for areas that have higher health care costs, including in rural and underserved communities
Expand reliable, high-speed internet access in rural communities to enable telemedicine and reform health care policies to improve reimbursement for telemedicine services
Fund residency programs, prioritizing hospitals that serve rural and underserved communities, and high-demand specializations including primary care
Reform our immigration system to allow foreign-born physicians to more easily practice in the United States, prioritizing underserved communities
Establish incentives through Medicare to promote the use of nurse practitioners and physician’s assistants to have full practice authority, as in 22 states and the District of Columbia, to increase the number of individuals covered by healthcare services
Provide grants through Medicare to teaching hospitals and medical schools to establish urban-rural rotation programs to expand healthcare capacity in rural communities, provide practical learning experience in these communities, and establish relationships with local health providers for future employment
Repeal the Hyde Amendment to ensure publicly-run healthcare programs can provide comprehensive reproductive health care services, including abortion and eliminate unnecessary restrictions on access to abortion care.
Implement strong nondiscrimination protections for the provision of health services to ensure all people have access to high-quality affordable healthcare
