LGBTQ Equality
Every person has the right to love who they want and identify as who they are. As mayor, I implemented a local non-discrimination ordinance and, as President Obama’s HUD Secretary, I instituted an equal access rule for LGBTQ youth and families experiencing homelessness. We must ensure all LGBTQ individuals are free from discrimination and enabled to thrive to their full potential.
When I’m president, we will advance equity for the LGBTQ community.
Pass the Equality Act so members of the LGBTQ community cannot be discriminated against in employment, housing, and public accommodations
Enforce the Equal Access Rule to allow transgender shelter-seekers to be accommodated in federally-funded homeless shelters according to their gender identity
Defend reproductive justice, ensuring that reproductive healthcare is available to all people regardless of gender or gender identity, repealing the Hyde Amendment and only nominating justices who respects the precedent of Roe v. Wade
Ban the practice of conversion therapy for all LGBTQ minors
End discrimination against LGBTQ families in the immigration and citizenship systems
Enable people in the trans community to serve in the military without fear or prejudice
Fight to end HIV/AIDS stigma
Stop discrimination in blood donations against MSM and members of the LGBTQ community
End discrimination against LGBTQ people and families in the foster care and adoption systems
Direct federal resources to help prevent violence against transgender women, particularly transgender women of color, and ensure that all people are safe in their communities
End the over-policing of LGBTQ people that results in higher rates of interaction with the criminal justice system
