Reproductive Justice
Reproductive justice means that every person has the right to make decisions about their own bodies. I will continue defending the constitutional right to abortion, including for the trans community, from the onslaught of attacks from far right extremists.
As president, I will work to ensure everyone the reproductive health care they need and that reproductive justice is a reality for all.​
Protect the constitutional right to have an abortion
Appoint judges at every level of the federal court system who understand that Roe v. Wade is settled law
Advance maternal health, sex education, and contraceptive access
Repeal the Hyde Amendment and ensure publicly-run programs, including Medicaid, Medicare, and the Indian Health Service are able to provide a full range of reproductive healthcare services, including abortion.
End both the domestic and global gag rules.
