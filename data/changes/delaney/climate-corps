Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our world. The effects will only get exponentially worse over time without strong commitments from the government and the people to address it.
In addition to calling for the implementation of a carbon tax and dividend, investing in negative emissions technology that will remove carbon from the atmosphere, and increasing the renewable energy research budget 5x, Delaney proposes the creation of the Climate Corps. The Climate Corps would be part of his National Service Program and would provide opportunities for recent high school graduates to work in low-income urban and rural communities. They would support these communitiesâ€™ transition to a green economy, work on environmentally friendly projects, and fight climate change by working on the ground. Under-resourced communities for too long have suffered the most from pollution and climate change, all too often lacking clean water to drink and clean air to breathe. We must provide the manpower and resources to support these communities and recognize that all Americans have a right to a clean, safe, and healthy environment.
In partnership with the government, community-based organizations and local businesses, Climate Corps members can help communities:
Identify the most pressing local needs that are hindering the community from transitioning to more environmentally friendly practices
Assist in clean energy projects including solar installation, improving building efficiency, developing community gardens, and increasing awareness about sustainable practices
As we have seen throughout this country and the world, the youth are energized, engaged, and ready to roll up their sleeves to do their part in combating climate change. The Climate Corps will help harness that enthusiasm and channel it into transformative projects.
