Iran is one of the most destabilizing and dangerous regimes in the world. As a leading state sponsor of terrorism, the government continues to threaten the U.S. and our allies.
We must do everything we can to avoid military conflict and pursue multilateral diplomatic solutions to de-escalate tensions. That is why Delaney supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), because while imperfect, it was successful at curbing Iran’s nuclear program. As president, he would rejoin the JCPOA, but insist on a longer duration to ensure long-term compliance. The JCPOA was the best arrangement that six of the leading nations in the world, plus the European Union, could reach to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. At the time the Trump Administration withdrew from the JCPOA, Iran was in compliance with the terms. U.S. withdrawal has become a provocation for the Iranians to not feel constrained to abide by the JCPOA, which has made the situation with Iran inherently more dangerous. 
In addition, Delaney would make clear to the Iranian regime that, while the JCPOA does not address Iranian ICBM developments or Iranian complicity in terrorist activities, the United States will independently of the nuclear deal take strong measures to respond to any such conduct. Iran is a bad actor that funds proxies, threatening U.S. allies and contributing to regional instability. A Delaney Administration would use all diplomatic and economic tools at its disposal to hold Iran accountable.
