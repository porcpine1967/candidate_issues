To help bring people from different backgrounds together, Delaney is proposing amandatory national serviceprogram to provide opportunities for young people to give back to their country and to meet and work with people from all backgrounds.
Every American will complete a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 2 years of mandatory national service when they graduate high school, or turn 18The National Service requirement will apply to individuals born after 2006, but will phase in over time
To meet the National Service requirement, participants can choose one of four options:serving in our nation’s military (the requirements and duration will continue as they currently exist)
serving in a new expanded Community Service program
serving in a new National Infrastructure Apprenticeship program
serving in a newly created Climate Corps
Community Service
Community Service would operate similarly to AmeriCorps or the Peace Corps
Participants in the Community Service track would work on projects such as mentoring and literacy tutoring for disadvantaged students, awareness programs for public health campaigns, outreach activities for social service programs, and structured after school care programs
Infrastructure Apprenticeships
The government would enter into public/private partnerships with private companies and trade unions to offer infrastructure apprenticeships
Private companies would be awarded contracts to undertake projects such as improving public parks or renovating federal buildings to make them environmentally green
Trade unions will be utilized as the programs can leverage the successful apprenticeship model used by the trade unions
Those who complete the apprenticeships would receive a professional certificate proving mastery of particular skill sets
To implement infrastructure apprenticeships, all federal contractors would be required to design and implement an apprentice program
Encourage other companies to do their patriotic duty and follow suit, perhaps using a model that’s been tremendously successful in Switzerland, where companies pay students to work as part-time apprentices
Climate Corps
To fight climate change, participants would assist in clean energy projects, including solar installation, improving building efficiency, developing community gardens, and increasing awareness about sustainable practices
Participants would be stationed in rural and low-income areas to assist communities’ transition to a green economy and invest in environmentally friendly projects
Benefits:
The program will be paid; the salary/stipend will vary based on regional cost of living and whether housing is provided through the program
1 year of service will result in 2 years of free in-state tuition and fees at a public university, community college, or technical school
2 years of service will result in 3 years of free in-state tuition and fees at a public university
Learn skills to be used for future jobs
Brings people together by exposing participants to people from different economic backgrounds, people from different parts of the country, and people with different political beliefs, which will restore an understanding of our common American identity and renew belief in our common purpose
Boost for local infrastructure, conservation, and community projects
Creates a nationwide sense of service and patriotism
