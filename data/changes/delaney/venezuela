The U.S. should respect the desires of the Venezuelan people. It is up to the people of Venezuela to decide who will lead their government.
Delaney believes that Nicolás Maduro is not the legitimate president of Venezuela as he declared victory in an illegitimate election. Delaney supports the elevation of Juan Guaidó to president following the Venezuelan constitution and will continue to speak out in favor of Guaidó’s leadership. To hold Maduro accountable for flawed and unfair elections, human rights violations, and for withholding humanitarian aid for the Venezuelan people, Delaney supports the use of economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure.  He has called for free and fair elections so the people’s voices are truly reflected in their government. As president, Delaney would provide substantial humanitarian support via USAID and through our participation in multilateral agencies such as the OAS and Inter-American Development Bank.
