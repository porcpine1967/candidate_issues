Issues
Education  Teachers
Do you feel that it’s getting harder to get a decent education unless you pay for it?
Are you worried about the state of our schools for both teachers and the students?
I worry about those things too. We need to make sure we are investing in the future of all of our children. In order to invest in our future, we have to provide adequate resources and meaningful accountability to ensure that all our students have equal access to quality education.
