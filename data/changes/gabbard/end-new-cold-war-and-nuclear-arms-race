End the new Cold War and nuclear arms race
Shortsighted, self-serving leaders in the grip of the military industrial complex have brought us into a new Cold War and nuclear arms race with Russia and China, threatening the future of the planet and the entire human race. On day one of my presidency, I will call a summit between the United States, China, and Russia to work to end this new Cold War, stop the arms race, reduce tensions, and increase cooperation going forward.

Quotes:
“I enlisted in the Army National Guard after the terrorist attack on 9/11, served as a soldier for over 16 years and deployed twice to the Middle East. In Congress I have served for over six years on both the Foreign Affairs and the Armed Services Committee. As president I will end these counterproductive and wasteful regime change wars, work to end this new Cold War and nuclear arms race and take the trillions of dollars that we’ve been spending, and invest those resources in serving the needs of the American people - healthcare, education, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, protecting our environment. There are many urgent needs here that we need to address and we’ve got to get our priorities straight.” (Quote)
I think it's important, for the sake of our country's national security, to keep the American people safe, and in the pursuit of peace, for our president and commander in chief to have the courage to meet with leaders of other countries — whether they be adversaries or potential adversaries — in order to achieve peace and security.” (Quote)

Our campaign is growing and unifying the American people around the core message of putting the interests of the people first — ending the new Cold War, arms race, and regime change wars, and redirect our resources to rebuilding our communities.
