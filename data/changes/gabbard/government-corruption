Government  Corruption
Do you think lobbyists and big money should be ejected from politics?
Are you tired of candidates who allow big money to shape their political decisions that affect you?
I agree this needs to end. The corrupting power and influence of big money special interests drives the agenda in Washington DC and is a direct threat to our democracy. As president, I will work fiercely to get corporate money and lobbyists out of politics and put you back in control of your government. Weâ€™ve got to close the legal loopholes that give special interests so much influence and take away your voice.
