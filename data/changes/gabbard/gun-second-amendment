Gun  Second Amendment
Do you worry every time your child goes to school that their school might be another to fall victim to a mass shooting?
Do you believe it’s important to uphold the second amendment but want sensible precautions to be sure those seeking to do harm to others can’t acquire a firearm to do so?
I will uphold our constitutional right to bear arms while also upholding our responsibility to keep our children and communities safe.

Quotes
I love our freedom...The freedom that is enshrined in our Constitution and our Bill of Rights. The freedoms we fight to protect [including] the right to bear arms (Fourth of July email 2019)
“The time for action is now. We cannot allow partisan politics to get in the way of taking meaningful action in areas where both parties agree and that have the support of most Americans across this country. Here are a few examples: Both Democrats and Republicans support legislation I have co-sponsored to ban bump stocks. Both Democrats and Republicans support legislation to uphold Second Amendment rights and strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Now is the time for us to come together and to take meaningful action towards responsible, common sense gun safety reform.” (Link)
