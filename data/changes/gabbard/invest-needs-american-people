Invest in the needs of the American people
I will be your voice in Washington. I will put an end to the failed policy of being the world’s police and nation builder, redirecting the trillions of dollars wasted on regime change wars and weapons to meet your needs here at home. We will work side-by-side, treating others with respect, and ensure a cleaner, safer, and healthier future for all Americans.
Tulsi's record:
Quotes
“I look at each issue on its own merit. Partisan politics don't matter. It only matters whether something is good for the American people or not. That’s why many have a hard time figuring me out. I don’t play their games. I don’t fit in their boxes.” (Link)
“I love our country. It’s why I decided to enlist after 9/11, why I serve in Congress, and why I’m offering to serve as your commander in chief — to protect you, our Constitution, our freedom.” (Link)
“The presence of PAC money in our political system has put corporations and special interests ahead of the people who elect us to serve.” (Link)
I know what patriotism is  I’ve known many great patriots throughout my life. Trump is not a patriot. As president, I will bring this spirit of real patriotism to the White House, serving the interests of all Americans, not just the rich and powerful. (Link)

Tulsi Gabbard: Stand up against Big Pharma / insurance companies
We must stand up, and fight for the soul of our country. Stand up against bought and paid-for politicians, who kowtow to special interests, selling their votes to the highest bidder Instead of draining the swamp, our president has turned it into a cesspool of corruption. We must stand up against big pharma and insurance companies who extort those who are sick, who put their profits above the health of our people. We must fight to ensure that every American gets the quality healthcare they need, through Medicare for All.
