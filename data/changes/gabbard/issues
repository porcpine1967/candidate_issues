Issues
Please join me in ushering in a new century of peace and prosperity, where we all have clean air to breathe, water to drink, and food to eat; where all are treated equally and have respect for each other regardless of our race, nationality, how we worship or who we love; a century that will fulfill the promise of America, of freedom, justice, equality and opportunity for all.
