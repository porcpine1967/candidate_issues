Enough.
In 2017, nearly 40,000 people were killed by guns in America. Gun violence is a national epidemic and a public health emergency. We’re not waiting for a good idea – we have good ideas. We’re not waiting for another tragedy – we have seen the worst human tragedies we can imagine. What’s missing is Republicans in Washington having the courage to stand up to the NRA.
Kamala Harris has a simple message: We’re not waiting any longer.
If Congress fails to send comprehensive gun safety legislation to Harris’ desk within her first 100 days as president – including universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, and the repeal of the NRA’s corporate gun manufacturer and dealer immunity bill – she will take executive action to keep our kids and communities safe.
Here are the key points of Kamalas plan:
Mandate near-universal background checks by requiring anyone who sells five or more guns a year to conduct background checks on all gun sales.
Revoke the licenses of gun manufacturers who break the law (including negligence laws and unfair trade practices) and take them to court if need be. 
Reverse Trump’s dangerous change to prohibited persons guidelines which has allowed thousands of fugitives with outstanding arrest warrants to buy guns. 
Close the “boyfriend loophole” to prevent dating partners convicted of domestic violence from purchasing guns. 
Ban AR-15-style assault weapons from being imported into the United States.
