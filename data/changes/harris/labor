As Kamala travels across the country, she is talking to families about their top-of-mind concerns. Those 3 AM worries keeping people up at night. For the vast majority of us, these are shared concerns: how to find a good-paying job; how to afford needed health care; and how to make sure their children get a quality education.  
We can do this by creating more and better jobs for the economy we have today while we also actively prepare for the economy we will have tomorrow. And one of the most important ways to build a strong economy is to have a strong labor movement where every worker can join a union. As president, Kamala will return power to workers, hold corporations accountable, and continue to support workers as our economy evolves. 
Here are the key points of Kamalas plan:
Make sure that everyone is able to join a union, including by banning “right to work” laws and strengthening union protections for private-sector employees.
Establishing baseline labor protections for all employers, including overtime protections and raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. 
Create new protections to protect workers and hold corporations accountable.
Ensure all workers are supported as the economy changes.
