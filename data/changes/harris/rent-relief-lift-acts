Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages are making it difficult for working people to keep up with cost of living increases. Our national affordable housing crisis is causing working families to stay up late at night worrying about how they’ll make ends meet. Kamala believes that in America you should only have to work one job to put food on the table, so she’ll fight to make sure that we support working Americans. 
Kamala’s Rent Relief Act will help keep families in their homes by creating a refundable tax credit for renters who pay more than 30% of their gross income for the taxable year on their rent including utilities. Recipients can use that money to help pay their rent and stay in their homes. And people who live in government-subsidized housing will be able to claim the value of one month’s rent as a tax credit to provide relief from rising costs.
Kamala’s Livable Incomes for Families Today (LIFT) Act will provide working and middle class families with a tax credit of up to $6,000 per year ($500 monthly). Instead of giving tax breaks to the richest Americans, Kamala will repeal the Trump tax cuts and use the money saved to help make sure the LIFT Act can give working people a little extra support.
