As Americans, this is our moment to act on climate change and to invest in a clean energy economy that will grow millions of jobs in communities across the country.
Governor Jay Inslee knows that defeating climate change is the defining challenge of our time and that it must be the foremost priority for the next president. Devastating disasters and rising pollution have claimed lives, cost the economy billions and threatened the places Americans live, work and raise families.
Jays climate plan will meet the climate challenge head-on, while creating jobs building a clean energy future. Thats what he has done in Washington state, and its what hes proposing for the nation.
