Senator Klobuchar’s Global Pandemic Prevention, Detection, and Response Plan
Jan 30 · 2 min read
The recent outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus is a stark reminder of the persistent threats posed by infectious diseases. Senator Klobuchar believes the United States must continue to lead the global fight to prevent, detect and respond to pandemics. In the Senate, she has championed efforts to address outbreaks at home and abroad. She successfully secured critical funding to combat Ebola in West Africa, helping strengthen health care infrastructure. And as Chair of the Senate Steering and Outreach Committee, she spearheaded efforts to rapidly address the spread of the Zika virus and support local prevention measures and research. As President, she will prioritize taking on global pandemics and protecting U.S. national security. She will:
Renew U.S. leadership and recommit to the Global Health Security Agenda, an initiative launched under the Obama administration to respond to the threat that infectious diseases pose to the global community.
Work with our allies and through multilateral organizations like the World Health Organization to improve local health infrastructure in at-risk countries and regions.
Fully fund U.S. departments, agencies, and programs that are on the front lines in preventing and responding to outbreaks, both at home and overseas, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, State Department, United States Agency for International Development, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.
Strengthen early-warning systems to detect and respond to outbreaks on the ground before they spread into full-fledged pandemics.
Develop the global rapid-response system for deploying international medical teams to respond to outbreaks at the source.
Increase stockpiles of existing vaccines and treatments and streamline delivery systems for rapid deployment during outbreaks.
Invest in capabilities for accelerating the production of new vaccines and treatments when new pathogens emerge.
Leverage public-private partnerships that can unlock new investments and innovations.
