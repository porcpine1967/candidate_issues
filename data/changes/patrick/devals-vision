For Everyone, Everywhere
I am running for President to deliver meaningful change that lasts — not for the sake of change itself, or in the service of some slogan or passing catchphrase. But to help America keep her foundational commitments, to renew the American Dream, and to put it within reach of everyone everywhere.
That’s why I am proposing the policies to come. They are the means to a very ambitious but achievable end. They are the tools, the innovations and the investments I believe we can and must achieve to renew the American Dream. This space offers an overview of the full platform. Over the course of January, we will be announcing more details about each agenda here, on Medium, and at events around the country.
On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Governor Patrick released An Equity for Black Americans. Read it here. 
The Deval for All Policy Platform
Opportunity Agenda

Reform Agenda
Fix big systems  like health care, immigration, criminal justice, and taxes  so that they align with our values and enable the American Dream.
Democracy Agenda
Renew our democracy  from voting to national service to civics education.
Leadership Agenda
Rebuild American power and influence in the world based on the strength of our values.
Opportunity Agenda
Opportunity is central to the American Dream.  To assure a future where all Americans — without regard to race, ethnicity, gender identity or orientation, or where they choose to live — can build a secure and prosperous future, we need an economy that grows out to the middle and the marginalized, not just up to the well connected.
My detailed plan for expanding economic opportunity for every American everywhere stands on three pillars: education, innovation, and infrastructure.
Education.  In an increasingly knowledge-based global economy, I believe Americans everywhere should have ready access to first-rate education—from pre-K through college, and beyond through life-long workforce development and retraining.  In short, Americans should have the chance to prepare themselves fully for citizenship, for work and for life.
Innovation.  I believe America can and should cultivate the innovative industries that generate high margins and high wages, such as precision manufacturing, urban and regenerative agriculture, life sciences, gaming, cyber security, media, transportation, financial services and health care.  My administration will also promote entrepreneurialism in local communities beyond the capital centers of the East and West Coasts through access to capital, and business incubation and mentorship.  And we will incentivize employee ownership and profit sharing, and impact investing, so citizens have real opportunities to build wealth and business takes a stakeholder approach to long-term value, accounting for its impact on workers, the community and the environment as well as owners.
Moving to a carbon-free future also presents enormous opportunities for us to lead research, development, and commercialization of alternative energy, energy efficiency and energy storage—and we will address these opportunities at length in my forthcoming proposal to address the climate emergency.  
Infrastructure.  We will rebuild and modernize America’s infrastructure—the investments we make through our government to help people help themselves.  This includes our physical infrastructure: roads, rails, bridges, universal broadband, affordable and workforce housing, the electric grid, drinking water systems, airports, ports and railroad stations, and more sustainable public buildings.  But it also includes our social infrastructure: the social services, worker protections, and anti-poverty programs that enable Americans to take risks and prosper.  This is the unglamorous work of government but it creates good jobs in the short-run and the necessary platform for private investment and personal ambition in the future.
The proposals in this Opportunity Agenda are wide-ranging but ultimately target the same thing: ensuring that future generations of Americans have the opportunity to imagine a future of their own making and then a fair chance to reach for that future.  For me, this is the essence of the American Dream.

Reform Agenda
A Reform Agenda is about making meaningful fixes to big systems that consistently fail to meet modern needs, and have long excluded some Americans.  My administration will reform these big systems so that they align with our fundamental values: equality, opportunity, fair play.
This means a health care system that provides universal access to high-quality, low-cost health services everywhere and for every single individual.  It means an immigration system that provides human dignity and border security, and that encourages the determined and creative whose values align with ours to make their home here.  And it means, among other things, a justice system that focuses on preparing people to re-enter responsible life instead of just warehousing them.
Consistent with my track record as Governor of Massachusetts, we will fix these systems so that they align with our values and enable, instead of impair, the American Dream.
This agenda includes proposals designed to reform the interconnected systems set out below.  Reforms to other areas of governance that could easily be included on this list—such as solutions to address the climate crisis and fixes to our democratic institutions—are addressed in our Opportunity and Democracy Agendas.
A Compassionate and Modern Immigration System
Gun Safety Solutions
Fairness in Criminal Justice

Democracy Agenda
For too long, we’ve treated our democracy like it could withstand infinite abuse without breaking.  For our democracy to work for all citizens that must change.  Our Democracy Agenda is about ending the many abuses and barriers that have crept into our political system to engineer outcomes at odds with the public will.  The building blocks of our democracy should be more responsive to the people, and enrich the social fabric of our nation.
In my first 100 days, I would prioritize legislation to fix our broken democracy.  The over-influence of money in our politics (much of it dark), hyper-partisan gerrymandering, voter suppression and the influence of lobbyists explains why our democracy no longer can be counted on to produce democratic outcomes.  These changes are foundational, and enable the success of other far-reaching legislative proposals.
The division in our national politics exaggerates divisions in our country.  So, as a further element of our Democracy Agenda, we will propose universal national service, a paid opportunity for all 17- and 18-year-olds to provide military or civilian service, and new opportunities for older Americans to serve.  In addition to addressing many unmet needs, service alongside other Americans of different backgrounds and perspectives provides a vital way to enable Americans to know each other and counteract the many efforts to divide us.

Achieve Universal National Service
Clean Up Our Politics
Strengthen Democratic Institutions
Leadership Agenda
Our Leadership Agenda is my plan to rebuild American stature and influence in the world on the strength of our diplomatic, economic, military and intelligence resources — and most importantly our values.
I believe American leadership should be steady, reliable, firm and consequential. Instead of bullying or demeaning other countries and peoples, instead of erratic and unpredictable international partnerships, instead of limitless war with only limited impact and objective, we will act deliberately and responsibly, in close consultation with our allies, and in service of American security and economic interests, and the world’s interest in peace and justice.
Ultimately our unique authority rises and falls with our ability to show the world that “we are who we say we are.”
The world faces many challenges — too many to address in this agenda. This agenda is meant to reflect the approach I intend to take, and to apply that approach to a few specific challenges and opportunities America faces in the world.
