Investing in our Foreign Policy Capacity
As President, I will work to rebuild the respect commanded by the office of the Presidency, which has been eroded and degraded under the current administration. We must invest in building a professional, extensive and talented diplomatic corps, with a special focus on attracting talent from across the country to service. We must restore a respectful relationship between the executive and the intelligence community, and invest in strengthening our intelligence human capital.
Our administration will assess our military capabilities across the board to determine its preparedness to address future threats, looking for room to innovate, enhancing our cyber capacity, and ensuring that we are prepared for “swarm” warfare.
