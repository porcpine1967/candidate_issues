North Korea
Instead of publicity stunts, North Korea and the world should expect meaningful and serious diplomacy from the Patrick Administration with the objective of accomplishing meaningful and serious goals.  Working with allies, we must denuclearize the Korean peninsula and end the Korean conflict.  We can work toward that goal while remaining clear-eyed about the hurdles we will face along the way.  In my administration, we would consider partial sanctions relief only in exchange for North Korea’s credible, verifiable progress in drawing down its nuclear program on the way to complete denuclearization.
