Russia
Russia is an important country in the region and the world.  But we must address the broader issue of Russian aggression, including its continuing interference in our own democracy.  There are economic, social, educational and military actions we can and should take alongside our allies to contain Russian efforts to destabilize democracies.  Enhancing our cyber defense capabilities is a critical piece of that strategy.
A critical dimension of our Russia policy relates to Ukraine.  The success of Ukraine’s developing democracy is important.  The United States should continue to deliver essential military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine without conditions, should explore and develop trade relationships with Ukraine and should maintain our policy that the occupation of Crimea and Donbas are flagrant violations of international law.  My administration will work with allies in NATO to strengthen ties between Ukraine and NATO countries through meaningful cooperation in agriculture, cybersecurity, anti-corruption and, critically, energy.  We must also work with existing NATO allies to bolster security in other regions within striking distance of Russia to deter Russian aggression and protect NATO countries’ sovereignty.
