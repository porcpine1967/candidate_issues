South America
We will look to strengthen partnerships with allies in our hemisphere, who have been overlooked by successive administrations.  Our administration will work with regional allies to address the refugee crisis and the illegal transport of goods and people across borders.  We must work in concert with our allies to support the people of Cuba, to invest in broad regional development in countries like Haiti, protect critical climate assets in Brazil, and support the institutions of the burgeoning democracies across the Caribbean, Central and South America.
The United States’ response to the calamity in Venezuela under Maduro suffers from the failure over many years to build stronger alliances throughout the region with countries throughout the region.  Under our administration that will change. Diplomacy is essential to isolating the Maduro regime and securing lasting peace.  I will work to build a regional coalition including Cuba, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay—plus interested foreign partners like Norway and the Vatican—to provide international backing in favor of restoring Venezuelans’ democratic sovereignty over their own affairs.  That coalition will press for free and fair elections in Venezuela, and hold out the prospect that a freely and fairly elected democratic leader will enjoy meaningful partnership with the United States and its allies in helping to rebuild a prosperous and fair democratic society for all Venezuelans.
