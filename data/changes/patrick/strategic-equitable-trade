Strategic, Equitable Trade
I understand the skepticism we have of trade deals. Too often, trade arrangements negotiated behind closed doors have disproportionately benefited corporations to the detriment of workers and the environment. As President, I will not commit to a trade deal of any nature without being convinced that it would raise American wages, create American jobs, protect the environment, and empower workers at home and abroad. We should use trade policy to raise the global bar on labor conditions and environmental regulations, and to ensure fair competition and respect for rules of the commercial road.
The United States should actively pursue trade arrangements in markets where we have historically been under-represented, such as in Africa and Latin America, for the benefit of all partners. Such trade agreements can have strategic value and advance American interests in the world. This is particularly true in Asia, where the United States must use our substantial leverage in trade negotiations as the worldâ€™s largest economy to build alternative, more constructive trade partnerships in the Pacific rim as China expands its trading influence across the same region.
Reassess and Renegotiate All Trade Deals As Needed
I will direct my United States Trade Representative to critically assess every active trade agreement for its current and expected impact on workers, the environment, and other stakeholders, and we will be prepared to renegotiate every agreement as required to ensure that our entire trade policy serves our interests.
Fully Fund Trade Support for Workers
We must expand and fully fund U.S. programs to transition workers who have been impacted by global trade.
