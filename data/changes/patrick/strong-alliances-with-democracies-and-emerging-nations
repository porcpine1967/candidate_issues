Strong Alliances
In foreign policy, as in many things, relationships matter. Whether trying to reach a business deal or sign a treaty, I believe you start by making friends.
As President, I will renew our bonds with our traditional allies in Europe, North America, and Asia and cultivate bonds with other democracies. I believe it is also in the long-term interests of the United States to cultivate more robust economic, social and strategic relationships with other nations in Asia, Latin America and Africa.
Because some of the most pressing and vexing challenges facing America also face the whole world, I believe it is critical to strengthen ties with global allies and trading partners. Alliances makes us safer and more prosperous at home, and more effective abroad. Accordingly, I pledge to recommit the United States to NATO and the World Trade Organization, and to invest time, ideas and resources to strengthen the United Nations and other multilateral bodies. In partnership with multilateral organizations or purpose-built coalitions, we will:
Solve the climate crisis, including by re-joining the Paris Agreement, elevating goals consistent with the urgency of the challenge, and designating a global body to hold nations accountable.
Confront aggressors like Russia, Iran, and North Korea.
Rebalance power, regionally and globally, with China.
Advocate for human rights and the rights of globally oppressed minorities, such as the Uighur people in China, the Rohingya in Burma, non-Hindu minorities in India, the Yazidi in Iraq, and LGBTQ+ people all over the world.
Modernize our own and the worldâ€™s processes and readiness for the welcoming of refugees from war-torn, oppressive and climate-critical places.
