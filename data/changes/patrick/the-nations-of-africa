The Nations of Africa
As someone who has lived and worked in Northern and Sub-Saharan Africa in various capacities over many years, the nations of Africa have always struck me as among the most fertile, yet under-appreciated environments for economic, social, educational and security relationships with the United States in the world today.  The Patrick Administration will develop these relationships into the robust opportunities for sharing prosperity and spreading justice they should have been all along.
We must start now to build strong commercial partnerships with Africa’s emerging economies.  My administration, working with allies, will lead development investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare and governance.  We will also strengthen African countries’ access to global markets through regional trade agreements in the spirit of partnership, and expand efforts to counterbalance China’s growing economic and political influence across the continent.  Terrorist activity in African hot spots, such as northern Nigeria, must be checked.  I will also leverage our influence in international institutions to reflect the realities of Africa’s growth, such as by promoting more inclusive decision-making in the United Nations and international financial institutions.
