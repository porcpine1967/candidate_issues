ISSUES
Building a New Industrial Policy
When I am President I will never forget that workers come first, and that our economic policy cannot put corporations before the hardworking men and women of our country. My plan to re-empower workers and revive the American middle-class relies on six lines of effort: Doubling union membership in the US, closing the skills gap, rebuilding our forgotten cities, helping left-behind workers, decentralizing economic opportunity, and strengthening the American manufacturing.

Moving Our Economy Forward
Autoworkers have watched their jobs go overseas. Teachers are striking for higher wages and better working conditions. Hardworking men and women across the country are fighting for the same thing — to earn a living wage for a hard day’s work. With factories closing, wages not growing, and healthcare costs rising, the American Dream is out of reach for way too many.

Protecting Our Environment
Climate change is one of the greatest threats facing our planet and the clock is ticking. We can’t just reduce climate change — we need to reverse it!

Transforming Our Education System 
Every student deserves a quality education and the constitution requires it. But unfortunately, too often only students from affluent communities get the things that are critical to educational success – highly-trained teachers, social-emotional learning programs, afterschool programs, mental health counselors, healthy lunches, pathways for family engagement, and up to date books, technology, and curriculums.

Fixing a Broken Health Care System
Healthcare is a right — not a privilege. I helped pass the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which allowed millions to afford coverage for the first time in their lives.But, while the ACA made great strides in access to healthcare, our healthcare system is still broken. We have a long way to go and that is just the fact. Monthly premiums are still too expensive. Prescription drug prices continue to rise. And our life expectancy continues to drop year after year. A cancer diagnosis or a long hospital stay could lead to bankruptcy. In the wealthiest country in the world, this is unacceptable.

Improving Our Agriculture and Food System
It is time for us to help our farmers and fix our food system. Farmers are struggling. Obesity and diabetes rates are rising. There are so many communities without access to fresh produce. We need a comprehensive plan that strengthens our country’s small and regional farms, eliminates food deserts, and promotes healthy eating.

Getting Our Veterans The Help They Need
Our veterans put their lives on the line for our country. They deserve a government that matches their dedication. As President, I will reform the Veterans Administration (VA) in a way that will heal our veterans. This means fighting against efforts to privatize the VA, and making significant investments into modernizing and improving military health services through innovative care. This approach includes growing the VAs Whole Health program. The Whole Health program provides a more balanced treatment focused on wellbeing and customized health plans for individual vets.
