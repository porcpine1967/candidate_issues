Our Veterans Need Help
Our veterans put their lives on the line for our country. They deserve a government that matches their dedication. As President, I will reform the Veterans Administration (VA) in a way that will heal our veterans. This means fighting against efforts to privatize the VA, and making significant investments into modernizing and improving military health services through innovative care. This approach includes growing the VA’s Whole Health program. The Whole Health program provides a more balanced treatment focused on wellbeing and customized health plans for individual vets.
Over 20 veterans die from suicide each day in the United States. I won’t rest until that number is down to zero.
As the founder of the House Military Mental Health Caucus, I understand the importance of advancing evidence-based treatment when it comes to mental health and substance abuse. While the Whole Health program is vital to suicide prevention, it is not available everywhere. As President, I will make sure suicide prevention is front and center by ensuring every veteran gets the care they need.
Reforming the VA is only the first step. We must push federal initiatives that ensure we do not turn our backs on our veterans. These efforts should include legislation like Reducing Barriers for Veterans Education Act of 2019 that would include the price of applying to higher education institution. And legislation to support the survivors of fallen service members like the Military Spouses Surviving Equity Act. These pieces of legislation are just the beginning of what the federal government can do to make sure veterans and their families get the services they need and deserve.
Our veterans answered the call of duty, put their lives on the line, and were there for us when we needed them the most — now it is our turn to be there for them.
