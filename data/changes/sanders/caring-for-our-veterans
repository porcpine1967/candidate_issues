Caring for Our Veterans
If you cant afford to take care of your veterans, then dont go to war. These people are bearing the brunt of what war is about. We have a moral obligation to support them.
Details
While serious people can disagree in good faith about when our country should go to war, there should never be a debate over whether we fulfill the promises made to the men and women who have served this country in our military. As a nation, we have a moral obligation to provide the best quality care to those who have put their lives on the line to defend us. Just as planes and tanks and guns are a cost of war, so is taking care of the men and women who we sent off to fight the war. That includes caring for the spouses and children who have to rebuild their lives after the loss of a loved one. That includes caring for the hundreds of thousands of veterans with multiple amputations or loss of eyesight, post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. That includes veterans who are struggling to keep the jobs they rely on to pay their bills, and it includes the terrible tragedy of veterans committing suicide. We must:
Fully fund and expand the VA so that every veteran gets the care that they have earned and deserve.
Get veterans compensated faster by improving how compensation claims are processed.
Expand the VA’s Caregivers Program.
Expand mental health services for veterans.
Make comprehensive dental care available to all veterans at the VA.
