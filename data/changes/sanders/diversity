Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
This campaign is committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in hiring, in programming, and in all other aspects of the work we do. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are deeply connected to our mission, our success, and to serving the American people. Some organizational priorities include:
Building policies, procedures and services that uplift and protect everyone and do not lead to inequalities;
Creating teams and relationships among staff, volunteers, and supporters that are reflective of the populations we serve;
Increasing engagement of communities of color, women, those with disabilities, and all Â people historically shut out of electoral and caucus processes;
Prioritizing the inclusion of diverse communities in internal leadership;
Fostering a culture of open-mindedness, compassion, and inclusiveness;
Creating and maintaining opportunities for engagement, education, and discourse related to issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion; and
Changing the historical culture of inequity and exclusion pervasive in political campaigns.
