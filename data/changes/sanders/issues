Bernie Sanders on the issues
I’m running for president so that, when we are in the White House, the movement we build together can achieve economic, racial, social and environmental justice for all.
We say to the private health insurance companies: whether you like it or not, the United States will join every other major country on earth and guarantee healthcare to all people as a right. All Americans are entitled to go to the doctor when theyre sick and not go bankrupt after staying in the hospital.

A 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights
A 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights
Our campaign is calling for a 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights that guarantees all of our people the right to the basic necessities of life — and guarantees those rights regardless of Americans’ income, race, religion, gender, country of origin or sexual orientation.
Today, we say to the prison-industrial-complex that we are going to bring about real criminal justice reform. We are going to end the international embarrassment of having more people in jail than any other country on earth. Instead of spending $80 billion a year on jails and incarceration, we are going to invest in jobs and education for our young people. No more private prisons and detention centers. No more profiteering from locking people up. No more war on drugs. No more keeping people in jail because theyre too poor to afford cash bail.

No more snatching babies from the arms of their mothers.

Time and time again, our Native American brothers and sisters have seen the federal government break solemn promises, and huge corporations put profits ahead of the sovereign rights of Native communities.
