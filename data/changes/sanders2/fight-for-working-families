We need leaders who will fight for the interests of workers, not just the 1%.
In the richest country in the world, there is no state in which working 40 hours at the state minimum wage generates enough income to afford a one-bedroom apartment.
It is unacceptable that workers rely on employers for life-saving health care. Working for a living should mean earning a living wage, and health care should be a human rightâ€”not a bargaining chip that keeps employees in coercive, exploitative environments. And families should have the security of knowing they can take care of sick loved ones and secure an education for their children. We must:
Raise the minimum wage to a living wage of at least $15 an hour.
Enact a universal childcare and pre-kindergarten program.
Make sure women and men are paid the same wage for the same job through the Paycheck Fairness Act.
Guarantee all workers paid family and medical leave, paid sick leave and paid vacation.
Make it easier for workers to join unions through the Workplace Democracy Act.
Make quality education a right.
Implement a green jobs program.
