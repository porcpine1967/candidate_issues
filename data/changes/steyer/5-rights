In order to create a society where everyone has a fair chance at success, we need five fundamental rights to be protected by law. No one — not corporations and their lobbyists — should have the ability to take any of these rights away, just to make a profit.

The Right to Health

The Right to Clean Air and Clean Water
Everyone has the right to breathe fresh air and drink clean water, free from industrial poisons. Corporations must not be able to violate this right for the sake of their profits.
The Right to Learn
Without guaranteed access to a good education, there’s no such thing as equal opportunity. Our government must protect the right to a free, quality, public education from preschool through college and on to skills training.
The Right to a Living Wage
No one should be forced to work more than one full-time job just to survive, and no one should see their raise eaten up by the rising cost of living.
