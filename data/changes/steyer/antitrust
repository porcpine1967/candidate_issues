Antitrust
Tom supports building a fair, people-powered economy that harnesses innovation and competition. He will ensure fair markets across all sectors and industries by aggressively enforcing existing antitrust regulations â€” and by enacting new antitrust regulations that hold big corporations accountable and break the corporate stranglehold on our government.
Because we must address the problem of monopolies if we are going to return the power of our government to the American people.
Tom will direct the Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Trade Commission by appointing officials who believe strongly in consumer protection and a competitive marketplace. His Department of Justice will enforce antitrust law across sectors, including in the agricultural sector, to end practices that put family farmers, food security, workers, environmental quality, and resilience at risk. And his Department of Health will ensure the health care system remains truly competitive and innovative and ensure a high standard of care for all Americans.
