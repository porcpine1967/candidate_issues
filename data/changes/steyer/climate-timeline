Tom’s Climate Story
Tom’s Climate Work and Wins 
Tom’s long track record on climate and his measurable results prove he’s the strongest candidate to take on the climate crisis. Powerful corporations have fought attempts to address the climate crisis and have targeted low-income and marginalized communities for their dirty, industrial power plants. Together, Tom and the people have taken them on. Tom’s grassroots efforts have protected ambitious climate policies,  put more renewable energy on the grid,  closed a corporate tax loophole to fund energy upgrades in schools, helped create the world’s largest 100% clean energy jurisdiction, and  stopped the development of a dirty gas power plant.
