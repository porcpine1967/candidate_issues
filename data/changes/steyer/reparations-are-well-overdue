Reparations are well overdue
For 400 years, this country has built a racist system of profits made on the backs of incarcerated black bodies.
Tom supports reparations to address this legalized discrimination and unfairness.
As president, Tom would create a Commission on Race — not to do more talking, but to take action. While Tom would make reparations a presidential priority, that shouldn’t stop the Steyer Administration from attacking systemic inequality wherever it rears its ugly head.
