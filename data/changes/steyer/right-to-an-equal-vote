The Right to an Equal Vote
A true democracy depends on the broadest participation possible.
But as things stand now, all Americans do not have an equal vote. The struggle to make sure everyone is allowed an actual voice in our democracy is ongoing. It’s up to us to un-rig the system that continues — even in the 21st century — to favor wealthy corporate donors and allow racially based attacks on the voting power of people of color.
It’s been well over a century since the women’s suffrage movement launched in Seneca Falls. It’s been more than 50 years since the march from Selma to Montgomery paved the way for the Voting Rights Act. Still, our voting rights today are far from secure. Deliberate voter suppression by Republicans, gerrymandering, and corporate money flooding our politics have made it impossible for us to obtain equality in our government. 
Many people have to travel for hours to get to their polling location. Many more are faced with hours of wait time just to get inside. People worry they’ll be penalized at their job for taking time to go to cast their ballot or that they’ll be prevented from voting due to intimidation or scare tactics. This isn’t fair or democratic, and now we have a president who is doing everything he can to exacerbate this inequality.
Voting must be easy and accessible for every American. Voting districts must be drawn fairly to assure no group of voters is effectively disenfranchised because of race or party. Without that, we are left governed by a democracy of dollars, not voters.  
We have to change this.
