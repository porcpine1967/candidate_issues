Tom Steyer Statement on House Impeachment Vote
Tom Steyer released the following statement after the U.S. House of Representatives passed two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump:
Today, the House of Representatives took the monumental and solemn step of impeaching the president of the United States. This historic vote was a giant leap toward preserving our democracy. No one is allowed to break their oath of office and put themselves ahead of the American people the way Donald Trump has.
I started a grassroots movement, more than two years ago, dedicated to holding Donald Trump accountable. Now, the 8.4 million Americans that signed our petition have had their voices heard. They knew this was a matter of principle, not politics. They knew America cannot have a president that uses the power of his office to advantage himself and obstruct justice. When our elected officials and institutions work to protect our democracy rather than to protect a lawless president, the American people win.
