Veterans
Our nation’s warriors deserve the best — both on the field and when they return home. They deserve our respect, our gratitude, and the solemn pledge from their Commander in Chief that America will never waiver in its commitment to them.
Tom is committed to veterans returning to their families and communities — and to their long-term well being.
Tom was the only presidential candidate to call for canceling the student loan debt for permanently disabled veterans. Tom will work tirelessly to support many top priorities involving veterans, including high suicide rates, homelessness, workforce training, mental health treatment, and student loan debt. We need to build upon the success of the VA hospital system, and Tom will make the investments necessary to ensure that the system is properly resourced and modernized.
