PROMOTING FAIR AND EQUAL TRADE:  President Trump has kept his promise to crack down on trade cheaters and to promote fairer and equal trade for all Americans.
In his first year in office, President Trump took action to protect America’s critical steel and aluminum industries, which were harmed by unfair trade practices and global excess capacity.
After an investigation, the Trump Administration found that global dumping of steel and aluminum had critically weakened the United States capacity to produce steel and aluminum in times with national security implications.
The President exercised his authority to impose a 25 percent global tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent global tariff on aluminum imports in order to protect our national security.
The tariffs on steel and aluminum will reduce imports to levels needed for domestic industries to achieve long-term viability.
In turn, the strengthening of our domestic steel and aluminum industries reduces our reliance on foreign producers.
As a result, these industries will be able to re-open closed mills, sustain a skilled workforce, and maintain or increase production.
Upon entering office, the Trump Administration began renegotiations of trade agreements that contribute to the U.S. trade deficit and harmed American workers.
One of President Trumps first actions was to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, advancing his agenda to protect American workers.
The President kept his promise to roll back the Obama Administration's bad deal on Cuba that benefited the Cuban regime at the expense of the Cuban people.

CRACKING DOWN ON CHINA FOR ITS TRADE CHEATING
The President directed his Administration to consider a range of actions to respond to China’s acts, policies, and practices involving the unfair and harmful acquisition of U.S. technology.
In August, the Trump Administration launched an investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 into Chinese acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation.
This was the first Section 301 investigation since 2013.
The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) confronted Chinas discriminatory technology licensing practices through a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute proceeding.
USTR led an extensive investigation based on a thorough analysis of evidence and comments received from academics, think tanks, law firms, trade associations, and American companies and workers.
The investigation concluded that China forces U.S. companies seeking to license technologies to Chinese entities to do so on non-market based terms.
China imposes contractual restrictions on the licensing of intellectual property and foreign technology into their country but does not put the same restrictions on contracts between two Chinese enterprises.
The investigation concluded that China directs and unfairly facilitates investments and acquisitions to generate large-scale technology transfers from U.S. companies to Chinese entities.
A Chinese government-backed fund helped Apex Technologies Co., a Chinese investment consortium, acquire a U.S. computer-printer maker which had previously sued Apex over patent infringement.
The investigation concluded that China conducts and supports cyber intrusions into U.S. companies to access their sensitive commercial information, such as trade secrets.
In 2014, the U.S charged five Chinese military hackers for cyber-espionage committed against U.S. corporations and a labor organization for commercial advantage.
An interagency analysis estimated that Chinas unfair acts, policies, and practices caused tens of billions in dollars in damages to the United States each year.
In response to China’s rampant trade cheating, the Trump Administration has placed 25 percent tariffs on approximately $250 billion worth of products that are supported by China’s unfair industrial policies
