Everyones vote should count equally  in every election  no matter where they live.
But right now, presidential candidates dont even go to places like Mississippi, where I was last night, because its a deep red state. They also dont go to deep blue states like California or Massachusetts because theyre not presidential battlegrounds.
I believe presidential candidates should have to ask every American in every part of the country for their vote, not just a few random states that happen to be close.
So at our CNN town hall last night in Jackson, Mississippi, I said its time to elect presidents with a national popular vote, and that means getting rid of the Electoral College. Sign our petition if youre with me.
This week, Im spending time in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama  talking with people about what matters to them in their communities. Like how we need to rebuild rural housing and make sure everyone can find a decent place to live at a decent price.
But the way it works right now, come general election time, presidential candidates dont travel to every state.
They zero in on just a few battleground states, and they dont get to hear about the issues that are on the top of peoples minds everywhere else in the country.
But your power in our democracy shouldnt be determined by where you live.
Everybody running for president ought to have to come and ask for your vote.
Add your name if you agree
Its time to abolish the Electoral College and to have a national popular vote.
