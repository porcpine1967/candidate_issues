Outsideof the obviously accepted illegality of sex with children, the US government has no business telling any of us what we can or cannot do with our bodies. REGARDING ABORTION RIGHTS, I AM ONE HUNDRED PER CENT PRO-CHOICE.
Abortion is a moral issue, but I do not believe the government of the United States has the right to legislate our private morals.I believe the decision of whether or not to have an abortion lies solely with the pregnant woman, according to the dictates of her conscience and in communion with the God of her understanding. I do not feel the government has an appropriate right to deny or restrict that decision. Expanding a woman’s understanding of her alternatives to termination is a good thing. But eradicating or limiting abortion rights would not decrease their number; it would simply mean that rich women have safe abortions, while poor women go back to risking injury, or even death, in the modern equivalent of back-alley abortions. That, to me, is morally unacceptable. In several states, restrictive measures such as the closing of abortion clinics and forced vaginal probes are currently in play. Planned Parenthood, a sole source of medical care for millions of women, is under attack in various states in an effort to block the availability of reproductive choice.
As your president, I would seek to protect the right of every woman to make her own decisions, in her own way, regarding her reproductive choices. The choice whether or not to terminate a pregnancy is difficult enough without having the government weighing in on the decision.
Therefore, I would vigorously resist any effort to restrict, limit, or diminish the reproductive rights and freedoms granted by Roe v. Wade.
