Make Washington, DC, a State
Washington, DC, has a population larger than two states, and yet it is not considered a state. This deprives residents of equal representation in the federal government, lacking both Representatives and Senators to promote their interests.
And yet, they still pay taxes, truly being an example of taxation without representation.
The residents of Washington, DC, should be afforded the same representation as other Americans, and it should be admitted as a State. To resolve any constitutional issues, an area of land containing the important federal buildings could be carved out and defined as the capital/Washington, DC.

Problems to be Solved
Residents of our nation’s capital are taxed without receiving representation in Congress.
Help make this idea a reality.
Hundreds of thousands of Americans right now are denied effective representation at the federal level while paying taxes and living in the shadow of the capital.  We should go ahead and make Washington D.C. a state. I like 50 as a number as much as the next guy but it’s past time for a change.
