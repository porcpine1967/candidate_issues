Make Election Day a Holiday
Everyone eligible to vote on election day should be free to do so. However, too many Americans are unable to take time off from work as they’re living paycheck-to-paycheck or are hourly workers who can’t lose the time.
Election Day should be a federal holiday, but that doesn’t go far enough as it doesn’t ensure economic motivations wont keep people from voting. On top of making that day a holiday, we need to implement tax breaks for companies that pay their workers for the time taken off to vote.
