Extend Daylight Saving Time All Year
Daylight Saving Time, or DST, was implemented during WWI to decrease energy utilization. While modern technology (specifically, AC units) makes the energy savings a wash, there are a lot of other benefits to the extended daytime hours.
While mornings are darker, evenings are lighter for longer. This leads to:
Increased exercise and outdoor activity
Lower crime, as the amount of time people are out in the dark decreases
Increased economic activity, as people are more likely to shop at night when it’s still light out
Fewer traffic accidents, as it’s easier to drive in sunlight
Additionally, removing the transition between the different times would:
Decrease traffic accidents that result from people being tired
Alleviate the increase in heart attacks seen following the time change
Prevent us from needing to reset our clocks (a minor annoyance, but an annoyance!)
Prevent us from being late to work (or exceedingly early, depending on the season)
Join the fight
Problems to be Solved
The switch from DST and back causes many issues
People generally prefer sunlight in the evening hours
Help make this idea a reality.
The switch from Daylight Savings Time literally kills people in accidents every year because people are drowsy.  I would advocate for a permanent adoption of Daylight Savings Time. No more hour-switching. Let’s just pick the time and stick to it. 
Goals
Decrease traffic accidents, heart attacks, and crime
Increase exercise and economic activity
As President, I will...
Work with Congress to pass the Sunshine Protection Act at a national level (thanks for the name, Florida!)
