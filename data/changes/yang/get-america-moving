Make it Easy for Americans to Move for Work
Many Americans live in areas where there are few available jobs. However, they also don’t have the means to move to an area with better job prospects. And frequently, professional licenses don’t travel to different localities or states.
In order to help people move to areas with more jobs, the federal government should subsidize the moving costs for Americans who are relocating for work. It should also work with state licensure boards to increase the mobility of individual licenses.

Problems to be Solved
Americans often want to move for better job prospects but can’t afford the costs.
Help make this idea a reality.
Americans are moving less than ever, which is bad for our labor market, our economy and our culture. Moving is an act of optimism that leads to adaptability and positive change. We need to get America moving again for new opportunities.
