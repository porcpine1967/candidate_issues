Making Taxes Fun
Currently, paying taxes is a slog. Instead, let’s make it a celebration.
Revenue Day—the day taxes are due—should be a federal holiday. That day should feature celebrations.
Each American should be able to direct 1% of their taxes to a specific project. During Revenue Day, these projects will be highlighted, showing what, exactly, America’s money was able to accomplish during the previous year. Initial profiles of the next year’s projects will also be announced so people can get excited for them.

Problems to be Solved
Taxes are viewed as a burden instead of a contribution to our shared society.
Tax day is dreaded, not celebrated.
Help make this idea a reality.
Running the country like a business means adopting basic things like appreciating your constituents.  If someone pays taxes, that’s great and we should make him or her feel like they contributed to important things that make people’s lives better.  Revenue Day should be a day of joy and celebration for our national community.
