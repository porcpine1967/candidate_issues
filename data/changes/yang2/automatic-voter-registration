Citizens have the right to vote. Not citizens who jump through varying hoops depending on the state in which they reside  all citizens.
When you turn the legal voting age (now 18), all American citizens should be automatically enrolled to vote. Upon interacting with a government agency (e.g., the DMV), information would be passed along to the relevant state voting board unless a person opts out of being enrolled to vote.
States that have implemented Automatic Voter Registration (“AVR”) have seen voter registration rates increase by 60+%. Additionally, having the infrastructure in place to provide AVR leads to having more accurate information on voters, thus “cleaning” the voter rolls and making voting day run more smoothly.
A move to AVR also usually coincides with a move to an electronic system, which is also cheaper and easier to update.
Why do we make it such a headache to register to vote?  When you turn 18 you should be automatically enrolled.  Other countries do this and, shocker, their voting rates are higher.
Problems to be Solved
Voting is a right of citizenship that should be made as easy as possible.
Guiding Principles:
Civic engagement
Equality
Goals
Automatically enroll all American citizens to vote when they hit the voting age
As President, I will…
Direct all federal agencies, upon interacting with an eligible voter, to provide electronic data to state voter boards and encourage automatic enrollment.
Provide funding to states to update their voter enrollment systems to electronic ones, and to integrate with federal systems, as well as each other, to ensure up-to-date voter information and easy transfer of data.
