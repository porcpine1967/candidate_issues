Capital gains and carried interest currently receive favorable treatment by the tax code. This privileges investors over workers and promotes speculation.
It’s irrational that we privilege capital gains and investment income versus earned income. The top 20% own 92% of the stock market, and the bottom half of Americans own essentially zero.

I’ve worked and invested and working is a lot harder.
