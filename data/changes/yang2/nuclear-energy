Nuclear energy is a relatively low-impact option for generating electricity. While the mining and enrichment of uranium has environmental impacts, and the storing of nuclear waste isn’t easy, it is overall an efficient way to generate energy.
With modern safety standards, it’s also a safe way to generate electricity. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards require that a risk assessment shows there less than a one-in-a-million chance of any radioactivity to be released to the environment.
Nuclear isn’t a perfect solution, but it’s a solid solution for now, and a technology we should invest in as we move to a future powered primarily by renewable energy.
Nuclear energy gets a bad rap because we all think about Homer Simpson and the possibility of contamination. The reality is that nuclear power is one of the most efficient and environmentally friendly paths forward to a more sustainable future.
Problems to be Solved
Nuclear power plants generate a majority of our “carbon-free” energy, but they only generate less than 20% of our overall energy, despite being cleaner than fossil fuels.
