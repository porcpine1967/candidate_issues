There are many communities that are underbanked throughout the U.S. that have to rely upon payday lenders. However, virtually every community has a post office, which are now looking for new sources of revenue and support. We should allow U.S. Postal Offices to provide check cashing, savings accounts, wiring money and other basic financial services.
In other countries, you can get a lot done at the Post Office aside from mail. We should follow suit here in the U.S.—it would reduce costs for consumers, make Post Offices more vital, and provide financial services in rural areas.
