There are millions of undocumented immigrants in this country who were brought here as children through no fault of their own. America is the only home they’ve ever known. They’ve assimilated into our culture and view themselves as Americans, despite living under the constant fear of deportation.  
This is wrong.
We need to find a solution that allows these individuals to formally integrate into our country.
See Andrew’s policies on the Pathway to Citizenship, and Southern Border Security for a more complete view of how he’d address this complex issue.
Children who have never known any life other than growing up in America should not be living in fear of being deported from the only place they have ever known.  We should assure them that this is their home and their future is here. I am the son of immigrants. I understand what this country can do for families and what it means to people. 
Problems to be Solved
Millions of children were brought into this country illegally, and have made a home in America, but they're not protected with a legal status.

Support the DREAM Act as a part of comprehensive immigration and border security reforms (see my policy pages on Southern Border Security and a Pathway to Citizenship to get a sense of the key parts of the comprehensive plan).
