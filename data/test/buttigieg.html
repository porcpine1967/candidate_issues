<div class="block-rich_text"><div class="rich-text"><p>We’re on the verge of a new American era, and this election is a defining moment for our nation. Rapid developments in technology are making changes to our lives that we could have never imagined just a few years ago. We face a climate emergency that threatens communities across America. How we manage the changes coming our way will define not just the next four years, but the next century.</p><p>Pete has seen how politicians in Washington have let these problems get worse and worse, and knows that we need a fundamentally new and different approach to fix our broken political and economic system. We need an economy where everyone has a role and everyone can succeed. We need a society where everyone feels they belong, where our differences make us stronger and move us forward, even in the face of a party and a president that are taking us backward. And we need a President who embraces the seriousness of the moment, but is free of the bad habits and outdated thinking that got us here.</p><p>As the economy transforms, we need policies that can adapt to the changing environment and give workers a fair chance.</p><p>Decades ago, we were promised a rising tide of economic growth that would lift all boats. We got the rising tide–GDP went up, productivity went up–but our paychecks didn’t show it. Working class wages have stagnated since 1980.<cite>This statistic refers to the all-in pay and benefits (including employer-provided health care) of the bottom half of U.S. earners. See: Piketty, Thomas, Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel Zucman.</cite> <a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/PSZ2018QJE.pdf"><cite>“Distributional National Accounts: Methods and Estimates for the United States.”</cite></a><cite> Quarterly Journal of Economics, 133(2), 2018, 553-609. Also, for more on the divergence between productivity and the wages of the typical worker, see: Bivens, Josh and Lawrence Mishel.</cite> <a href="https://www.epi.org/files/2015/understanding-productivity-pay-divergence-final.pdf"><cite>“Understanding the Historic Divergence Between Productivity and a Typical Worker’s Pay: Why It Matters and Why It’s Real.”</cite></a><cite> Economic Policy Institute Briefing Paper #406, September 2015.</cite> The need for new skills in a changing economy is one piece of the puzzle. But the hard truth is that while the economy changed, workers’ voices were systematically silenced. Our economy has been tilted towards the wealthy and away from the middle and working class because the people in power designed our laws and policies that way. That’s especially true when it comes to workers of color and women, who have historically been undervalued and excluded in the workplace. To ensure every American has a fair shot, that has to change. As we enter a new American era, it’s time we restored fairness and balance to our economy, so that <b>every</b> American can share in our country’s growth. And it’s time to help our nation’s workforce become more resilient, inclusive, and flexible, and more easily adapt to our dynamic, ever-changing economy.</p></div></div>

<div class="block-rich_text"><div class="rich-text"><p>We all know that the federal minimum wage failed to keep up with our changing economy, but that’s only part of the story. Economic models for employment are also changing, which is affecting worker bargaining power. At the same time, membership in private-sector unions–the same unions that gave us the minimum wage, the 40-hour workweek, and worker health and safety protections–has dropped to just 6%, in part because employers have pressured and harassed workers into not organizing in the first place. And membership in public sector unions has also fallen in recent years as they have come under attack.<cite>Bureau of Labor Statistics. “</cite><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm"><cite>Union Members Summary.</cite></a><cite>” January 18 2019.</cite></p><p>Business models are changing bargaining power.

Targeting the majority of Americans will lead to growth for the majority of Americans. That’s why Pete will assess how the economy is doing by income growth for the 90%–the vast majority of Americans who are not in the richest tenth.<cite>Mayor Pete will do so by directing his Bureau of Economic Analysis and Department of Labor to produce headline economic statistics for the bottom 90% of the income distribution, not just total GDP.

<div class="block-rich_text"><div class="rich-text"><p>At the end of the day, this is about fairness. Workers should have an equal seat at the table.  Corporations shouldn’t get to hide behind legal technicalities that let them mistreat and push workers down. If we work overtime hours, we should get overtime pay. We should also be able to bargain with a company to determine pay and work conditions. To make the 21st-century economy work for every worker, all of our nation’s workers should have the bargaining power they need to demand good jobs, fair pay, and safe workplaces. As the workforce changes with more women and people of color, we also have a moral and economic imperative to ensure historically excluded and undervalued groups finally enjoy the benefits of strong bargaining and labor protections.<cite>For a discussion of the NLRA’s exclusion of agricultural and domestic workers, for example, please see: Perea, Juan F. “The Echoes of Slavery: Recognizing the Racist Origins of the Agricultural and Domestic Worker Exclusion from the National Labor Relations Act.” 2011.</cite> <cite><i>Ohio State Law Journal</i></cite><cite> 95 (1).</cite> And we must ensure that equal pay for equal work becomes a business priority just as it is a priority for women across the  country.</p><p>Pete is laying out a set of policies to empower workers and raise wages, going above and beyond existing legislative proposals like the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. Pete’s goals are to accelerate wage growth for the broad middle class and restore our society’s  economic compact.

                <p>Workers cannot have a level playing field on which to advocate for
                    better salaries, benefits, and working conditions if they are unable to bargain with the company
                    or companies that actually set the terms of their employment. Yet all too often, U.S. workers
                    today find themselves shut out from bargaining with their real employers. For example, many
                    drivers on ridesharing apps are misclassified as independent contractors, while many fast-food
                    workers are considered employees of local franchises but not of the national chains that control

                <p>To ensure that workers can bargain effectively with the companies

                        <h4>Allow gig economy workers to unionize and earn a fair wage.</h4>
                        <p>Pete will support codifying the simple “ABC test” for
                                classifying workers nationally in order to prevent workers in the gig economy from being
                                denied minimum wage, overtime, and antidiscrimination protections–and their ability to
                                unionize. In order to classify a worker as an independent contractor under the ABC test,
                                an employer must demonstrate that the worker (A) is free from the employer’s control,
                                (B) is performing work that is outside the employer’s usual course of business, and (C)
                                customarily works as an independent business in that industry. The test will also ensure
                                that Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) protections like the minimum wage apply. As a
                                backstop to the ABC test and in order to guarantee collective bargaining rights to gig
                                workers, Pete will also propose amending U.S. law to allow independent contractors with
                                no employees, little capital investment, and substantially similar working relationships
                                with a single company to unionize.</p>

Transparency can help.<cite>Bennedsen, Morten, Elena Simintzi, Margarita Tsoutsoura, and Daniel Wolfenzon. “Do Firms Respond to Gender Pay Gap Transparency?” NBER Working Paper 25435.</cite> The public should know which companies are doing right by their female employees with fair pay, promotions, and family-friendly work arrangements, and which ones have glass ceilings.<cite>Family-friendly work arrangements are key for gender pay equity. See: Goldin, Claudia. “A Grand Gender Convergence: Its Last Chapter.”</cite> <cite><i>American Economic Review</i></cite><cite>, 104(4): 1091-1119. 2014.</cite> Pete will propose legislation to immediately make public the total pay gap at every large company: for every dollar that the company pays to male employees as a whole, how much does it pay to female employees?<cite>For example, if Acme Inc. in 2018 paid a total of $100 million to men and $70 million to women, then the government would publicly report that Acme has a 30% pay gap. This proposal requires no new data collection from businesses: the Labor Department can simply use the Treasury Department’s W-2 and gender data to add up all the dollars each company pays to each gender. Measuring the</cite> <cite><i>total</i></cite><cite> pay gap complements and improves upon measuring the</cite> <cite><i>median</i></cite><cite> or</cite> <cite><i>mean</i></cite><cite>pay gap, which companies can game by laying off low-paid women. Under Pete’s plan, a company that fails to retain women at any income level would look worse, not better.</cite> Unlike other data reporting proposals, the total pay gap does not require the government to collect any new information, can be released immediately, and is hard to game.<cite>The 2010 Dodd-Frank requirement that companies release CEO pay data took eight years in the courts before companies complied. Luckily, companies cannot drag their feet on the total pay gap because the government does not need any new data from them. The Labor Department can simply use the Treasury Department’s W-2 and gender data to add up all the dollars (wages plus benefits like health care and retirement contributions) each company pays to each gender. Measuring the</cite> <cite><i>total</i></cite><cite> pay gap is harder to game than the</cite> <cite><i>median</i></cite><cite> or</cite> <cite><i>mean</i></cite><cite> pay gap, which companies can game by laying off low-paid women. Under Pete’s plan, a company that fails to retain women at any income level would look worse, not better.</cite> Companies that employ mostly men, or that employ only men in their good-paying jobs, will have especially large pay gaps compared to their competitors. Those companies will face public pressure to pay women equally for equal work <i>within</i> jobs and also to hire, promote, and retain women <i>throughout the pay scale</i>. Total pay gap transparency would be a down payment on more granular reporting requirements, such as by gender, race, and job within companies–building on the Obama Administration’s Equal Opportunity Office compensation data collection.</li></ul></div></div>

Pete will support legislation to provide union organizers access to employees on company premises to talk about the benefits of unionization.

<div class="block-rich_text"><div class="rich-text"><p><b><h3>Expanding bargaining rights</h3></b></p><p>The cornerstone of current U.S. labor law, the National Labor Relations Act, was designed in 1935<a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/how-we-work/national-labor-relations-act"><cite>https://www.nlrb.gov/how-we-work/national-labor-relations-act</cite></a></p><p>for an economy in which almost all employers directly employed all of their workers, and lawmakers designated the individual employer as the default level for collective union bargaining in most cases. Workers would join a union at a single employer and engage in collective bargaining at the worksite level. Today, our modern economy is much more fragmented, threatening worker bargaining power even in industries where unions have traditionally been strong. Worker bargaining power is limited when workers are spread across many different competing employers. That problem can be fixed by allowing workers across multiple employers in the same business to bargain collectively. To help empower workers in the modern economy, Pete will, for the first time in American history, give working people the right to demand access to multi-employer bargaining. This means he will:</p></div></div>

To that end, Pete will:</p><p><b>Give preference in government contracts to firms that treat their workers well.</b><br/>As it stands, companies that take the high road and treat their workers well are at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for government contracts. To give an affirmative leg up for high-road employers, Pete will support legislation to give preference in the bidding process for federal contracts to companies that are unionized and offer good pay and benefits to all their workers. The federal government should not be using taxpayer money to support companies that do not support their workers. Pete would also prioritize strengthening and providing resources to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.</p></div></div>
<div class="block-rich_text"><div class="rich-text"><p><b><h3>Ensure workers access to the predictable hours, wages, and support they deserve</h3></b></p><p>Too many workers today are stuck in jobs that do not pay fair wages or provide them with the predictable schedules that they need to look after their families. To ensure workers have access to fair wages and predictable schedules, Pete will:</p><ul><li><b>Ensure workers have access to paid sick leave and paid family leave–no matter where they work.</b><br/>Almost 30% of private-sector workers in the United States lack access to paid sick leave, and in some industries it’s over 60%.<a href="https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2018/ownership/leave_all.pdf"><cite>“National Compensation Survey: Employee Benefits in the United States.”</cite></a><cite> Bureau of Labor Statistics. March 2018</cite> In addition to passing the Healthy Families Act, Pete would set up a national system of paid sick leave. For workers who do not receive at least 7 paid sick leave days from their employer, even under the Healthy Families Act, their employers would be required to pay in the equivalent of one hour of pay for every 30 hours they work, up to a total of 56 hours, into a state fund that these workers could draw from. If workers work for more than one employer, all employers they work for would pay in. Workers would be allowed to roll over these days from year to year. Workers should also have access to paid family and medical leave for more serious health and family caregiving issues, including parental leave. This is why Pete strongly endorses the FAMILY Act, to create a national paid family and medical leave fund similar to successful policies in several states.</li><li><b>Protect undocumented workers from retaliation when reporting labor violations.</b><br/>Employers should not be able to retaliate against any worker who wants the minimum wage enforced, supports union organizing, or seeks other protections under labor and employment laws. Making those protections clear and providing full remedies for undocumented workers is important–both to protect those workers from threats like being reported to ICE and also to avoid creating downward pressure on everyone’s work conditions and pay.<cite>Costa, Daniel.</cite> <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/california-immigrant-labor-laws/"><cite>“California Leads the Way: A Look at California Laws that Help Protect Labor Standards for Unauthorized Immigrant Workers.”</cite></a><cite> Economic Policy Institute Report. March 22, 2018.</cite> Pete would also support <a href="https://chu.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-chu-and-sen-menendez-introduce-bicameral-power-act-protect-immigrant">legislation</a> that would provide visas for victims of labor and employment law violations who are helpful in prosecuting those violations–just as we do for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and trafficking crimes.</li><li><b>Ensure visa portability.</b><br/>Workers who come to this country should not have to continue working for an abusive employer simply because their visa is tied to that employer. That not only hurts workers with visas by enabling employers to exploit them, it also hurts all workers by lowering labor standards across the board. Pete will propose reforms to temporary work visas so that workers can move to another employer in their industry and keep their visa. Pete would also support <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4777">legislation</a> that would provide greater transparency for temporary work visa programs.</li><li><b>Restore overtime regulations that would protect 8 million more workers.</b><br/><cite>Shierholz, Heidi.</cite> <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/trump-overtime-proposal-april-update/"><cite>“More Than Eight Million Workers Will Be Left Behind by the Trump Overtime Proposal.”</cite></a><cite> Economic Policy Institute. April 8, 2019.</cite> President Trump has rolled back the new overtime regulations from the Obama Administration, replacing them with ones that protect millions fewer workers–workers who are no longer guaranteed “time-and-a-half” pay when they work more hours for their employer. Pete would restore the Obama-era overtime regulations to ensure workers are protected and would pass legislation to strengthen overtime rules moving forward by ensuring that, in the absence of a collective bargaining agreement, overtime kicks in after 8 hours per day (in addition to over 40 hours per week) or over 7 days in a row.</li><li><b>Fund enforcement that would deal with the massive problem of wage theft.</b><br/>Too many workers are not paid the wages that they have earned from their employer. Almost  one-fifth of low-wage workers experience wage theft.<cite>Cooper, David and Teresa Kroeger.</cite> <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/employers-steal-billions-from-workers-paychecks-each-year/"><cite>“Employers Steal Billions From Workers’ Paychecks Each Year.”</cite></a><cite> Economic Policy Institute. May 10, 2017.</cite> Pete would ensure that federal agencies have all the resources they need to go after employers who don’t even pay their workers the minimum wage and overtime they’re owed–and that employers who steal from their workers face serious penalties.</li><li><b>Ensure that workers have access to predictable schedules – and if they don’t, that they are adequately compensated.</b><br/>Workers should know that they are going to get the predictable hours they need so that they can plan their lives and pay their monthly bills. Employers should not be able to require workers to be on call, or to demand that workers be at the workplace with little notice, unless they compensate those workers accordingly.<cite>Ansel, Bridget and Heather Boushey.</cite> <a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/modernizing-u-s-work-schedule-labor-standards-for-21st-century-families/"><cite>“Modernizing U.S. Work Scheduling Standards for 21st Century Families.”</cite></a><cite> Washington Center for Equitable Growth. June 2018.</cite> The Schedules That Work Act, which Pete strongly supports, would ensure that workers have access to predictable schedules, or receive compensation for their irregular schedule.</li><li><b>Endorse the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights.</b><br/>Today, domestic workers are excluded from basic employment and labor protections, which leaves workers who are disproportionately women, and particularly women of color, open to exploitation.<cite>Burnham, Linda and Nik Theodore.</cite> <a href="http://www.idwfed.org/en/resources/home-economics-the-invisible-and-unregulated-world-of-domestic-work/@@display-file/attachment_1"><cite>“Home Economics: The Invisible and Unregulated World of Domestic Work</cite></a><cite>.” National Domestic Workers Alliance. 2012.</cite> That’s why Pete endorses the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights Act which provides domestic workers access to the same employment rights as other workers–from overtime pay to antidiscrimination–and creates standards like harassment protections and fair scheduling to address the unique nature of their working conditions.</li></ul></div></div>
<div class="block-rich_text"><div class="rich-text"><p><b><h3>Pass a $15 federal minimum wage indexed to wage growth</h3></b></p><p>For too long, the typical worker’s wages have not kept up with expenses like health care, housing, and education. Pete wants to make sure that workers who are giving their all to an employer are getting paid fairly in return. By raising the federal minimum wage to $15, we can start taking steps to make sure that the economy is working for all workers. Over 33 million workers would benefit from raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025.<a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/minimum-wage-15-by-2025/"><cite>“Raising the Federal Minimum Wage to $15 by 2025 Would Lift Wages for Over 33 million Workers.”</cite></a><cite> Economic Policy Institute. July 17, 2019. The 33.5 million number includes directly affected workers and also workers who benefit as the pay rises ripple up the pay ladder: about 40% of wage gains after a minimum wage increase accrue to workers above the new minimum. See: Cengiz, Doruk Arindrajit Dube, Attila Lindner, and Ben Zipperer. “The Effect of Minimum Wages on Low-Wage Jobs”</cite> <cite><i>The Quarterly Journal of Economics</i></cite><cite>. Forthcoming 2019.</cite> We also need to index the federal minimum wage to median wage growth so that moving forward, both workers and employers know with certainty what it will be in the years to come. That’s why Pete strongly endorses the Raise the Wage Act.<a href="https://edlabor.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2019-01-16%20Raise%20the%20Wage%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf"><cite>“Raise the Wage Fact Sheet.”</cite></a><cite> U.S. House Education and Labor Committee.</cite> An important part of the Raise the Wage Act is ending the subminimum wage for disabled workers and ending the tipped minimum wage. No one in the United States should be exempted from minimum wage laws. This practice is indefensible.</p></div></div>
