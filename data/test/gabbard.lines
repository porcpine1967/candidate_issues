Many in Congress want to keep tax breaks for the wealthy and other "entitlements" and instead cut costs by sacrificing Medicare and Social Security in order to get our budget under control. Sacrificing Medicare and Social Security is not acceptable and I will stand up against such efforts.” (Link)
“We need to reinvest in and expand our two major Social Security programs, Old-Age, Survivors, Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI). Primarily, my administration will ensure Social Security's solvency by taking the trillions of tax dollars now spent on military spending and tax giveaways to the wealthiest American families and corporations and reinvesting them in these two Social Security programs.” (AFSCME questionnaire)
